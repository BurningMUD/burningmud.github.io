## OLC Documentation
Burning MUD has an entirely custom OLC (On-Line Creation) tool, which allows an author to build an entire zone in-game, and test it as you go. Intuitive commands allow simple ways to build rooms like walking in the desired direction to create a new room there, and a simple menu system that allows you to choose relevant values for your creations, as well as auto-calculating values for mob stats based on the level you define, which lets you focus on customization rather than the tedium of filling out basic numbers.

We have a high standard of quality for zones, and we will be glad to assist you in making sure your zone fits as a part of the world and has a special place in the game, as well as helping with game balance and Mobprogs to make sure your creation is polished and shines how you want it to!

## Mobprogs Documentation
Written in Word format, and saved into html, so the format might not be ideal, but it's an old document that needs to be reformatted. But, it's here in full, with syntax and info on all the customizations that coders have added over time. More information about the inception of Mobprogs, and how they ended up on Burning, can be found within the document itself.
