# Game Support

* Find an immortal when you are logged in to Burning (who god), or email support@burningmud.com. If you would like to receive assistance in-game and do not see an immortal, every temple in each major city has an altar where one can pray to the gods for help, which will send the prayer to online immortals. If an immortal is not available at that time, your prayer will be delivered when a God is availble.

# New Player General Advice

It is difficult to cover every useful topic to a new player here, and to dive into all the specifics would be to recreate the mud itself in a sense, so this is intended as broad advice about how to approach the game as a new player, and how to find the information in-game or elsewhere to learn what you need as you go. With any online game, it's difficult to absorb everything at once or to know what is meaningful without much context, so having good references available makes things easier.

The best way to learn is to play. MUDs may feel obtuse during your early moments of gameplay, like many big online games. There is a big world to explore out there, and it can be a little overwhelming at first! Other players may seem to be speaking in a foreign language, talking about game statistics as if they are common knowldge, but don't feel discouraged if things seem a little strange at first. It can take a little bit to find your baerings in this mythical world. Once you start to get familiar with some basic commands and learn how to play, it starts to come together and feel more natural. After awhile, you really forget that it's just a text game, in the way that reading an exciting book can transport you to another world, and similar to a book, it may feel like a little work to get started, but once you become invested it can be a very rewarding experience!

## What is a MUD?
A MUD is a Multi-User Dungeon, as it was originally coined. Humorously, a MUD could be thought of as a lazy man's Dungeons and Dragons, as it handles all of combat for you, and no dice rolling is required. It is generally considered an open-world online game with other players that is text-based. There are what are considered graphical MUDs, but these were mostly transitory experiences before full MMO games began to take over.

It's a similar question to, what is an MMO? Many players are already familiar with this term, and you could consider MUDs the same thing essentially, but in text form. The MMO games genre started life in the form of MUDs, and there were very many MUDs based on open source codebasese like Diku, Smaug, RoM, and later the graphical genre of MUDs was created and then eventually fully transitioned away from text-based output. Games like Ultima Online, Ever Quest, Runescape and World of Warcraft became very popular. Before such games existed, MUD's were very popular.

## Why should I play a MUD?
One might feel that a text-only game has many weaknesses when compared to a modern game. Graphics can help visualize your environment in a meaninful way, and 3D environments and worlds provide interesting emergent behaviors that add complexity to even simple systems. And we all enjoy nice artwork and ag

But the strengths of modern MMO games can also be weaknesses, in that it can take a lot of computing power to host graphical games online. This limits the fidelity of the graphics, and also once the game begins to age, the once wonderful graphics may begin to lose their luster. Writing does not get dated in this way. As well with the need for computing power, often MMO games are "sharded", which splits the playerbase into slices and you only see a portion of the playerbase at any time which prevents the gameservers and your client from becoming overloaded. This same weakness can prevent the world from being

## Why should I play Burning MUD?

Burning is a unuiqely fast-paced cooperative action game. It might sound like an oxymoron to say that a text game is fast-paced, but combat can be intense and satisfying in Burning, and split second decisions can mean life or death!

# Game Specific FAQ
## Finding new gear

As a low level character, one of your most important pieces of equipment is your weapon. A good weapon can make a big difference early on. As you gain levels, you will need to start filling out your gear more as the creatures begin to get stronger and more clever. Here are some ways to improve your gear.

* Check the donation chest near the temple in Karandras. Other players donate gear they don't need which will end up here. To determine if the gear is a good fit for you, you can "identify" objects contained within the donation chest. Learning which items are best for you is an on-going thing, but that which you get better at as you gain levels. What feels overwhelming at first can be very intimiately understood later. There are tons of items in the game to attain, but only a subset will apply to any one character, and over time you get an idea of what is good for your characters.

* Check player shops. Using the map of Karandras, you can find the tower of shops just west of the Market Square.

* Check the Auction House, which is located near the reception. Players may bid on objects put up for auction here.

* [Player Sites](/player_sites.markdown) have some advice about gear, as well as databases of known items.

* To learn more about gear and how it affects you, you should "identify" it. There are scrolls of identifaction at the magic shop, or spells for certain classes, and you can store items for in your item storage and identify items within it.

* Finally, asking other players on the gossip channel what gear might be good for your level could bring some useful assistance. It doesn't hurt to ask and many players discuss their equipment strategies together.

## Where should I go for xp?
* If you aren't sure, you can always ask for some advice on gossip. Many players know their way around the game and can point you to a few good zones for your level.

* Cartographers in each Temple City have maps showing the relative location of zones nearby. Check the "areas" command to see a list of zones in the game. You can filter this list by using commands such as, "areas 1-10", which displays a list of zones that fit within this range that are recommended for players who are level 1 up to level 10 max. These are recommended ranges generally, but you can explore anywhere you want. Only a few very dangerous areas may be blocked off from the lower level players.

* Again, [Player Sites](/player_sites.markdown) tend to have a lot of help here, and more specific help.

## My character can't see! It's too dark!
Some races have darkvision like Dwarves, and some like Humans do not. Some classes also learn a spell called Darkvision, which grants this ability when cast, but without any extra help, sometimes you may need a light source! As well, it is possible to discover and wear items that absorb light, which can counteract your light source(..It seems to absorb light!). Some light sources are also more powerful than others. If you are ever stuck and don't know how to get home, you can always use the Recall skill, to return back to the Temple where you entered the game.

## What can I do? I don't know any commands. How do I know what actions my character can perform?

Make sure to use the in-game "help" system, which is extensive and useful when there are a lot of details to remember. It may feel like a lot of commands, but you quickly learn which ones are useful in which context, and it becomes second nature. If you aren't sure about a command or topic, just search for it in the helpfiles and you might find what you are looking for. Helpfiles are always subject to updates, and if you need clarification on any helpfiles, other players may know the answer, or the immortals would be happy to assist.

You can learn about just about anything in the game. If you can't find something you are looking for, other players or immortals can help with some advice. To see a categorized list of most in-game commands, checkout the image link below. This is what you will see when you type "help" without any arguments in-game. Often commands have helpfiles associated with them, so you can lookup what they do if you aren't sure.

## Does the game have quests?
* Yes. There are what are termed auto-quests, which are entirely handled in-game by NPC questmasters, found dotted around the game. There are dozens of unique quests that you can join, which reward you with special rewards that are sometimes unique as well.

* We also do hosted quests, which are live events run by immortals that you can join. Most of the time these are announced ahead of time, but the events can range from hide and seek type events, to arena VS battles, to teaming up to take down emergent threats, and sometimes smaller events are hosted on the spot without prior announcement.

## Is there an objective or a win condition, or a final goal t othe game?
* No, frankly it's up to you what you want to do once you reach a
