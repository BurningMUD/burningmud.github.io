  Adventurer, be warned! Burning MUD is a fast-paced cooperative action game, where split second decisions can mean life or death! Join an ancient world of epic scale and difficulty spanning across two massive continents, fighting intense battles in groups of up to 50 players or more to defeat nearly immortal creatures.

  With Burning Multi-classing, there are over 60 deadly combinations of character classes to explore such as the Rogue/Mage, a deadly combination of treachery and magic, or the Templar/Templar, so focused in his holy arts that he can perform a miracle on a dying ally, or even something more exotic like the Nightblade/Warlock, whom embraces the dark arts and lives her life as an assassin.

  Team up and explore the depths of the Well, a 20-level deep cavernous expanse of over 6,000 procedurally generated rooms, each level harder and more rewarding than the last. Here you can find fragments of elemental essence, which when collected, can transform your character into a new race, and more.

  Become a powerful force in a massive world of over 400 areas, with thousands of unique items and creatures. Join us adventurer, as there are yet powerful foes who remain undefeated, and we need your help!

      A MUD is a Multi-User Dungeon. It is generally considered an open-world online game with other players that is text-based. The MMO genre started its life in the form of MUDs, and there were many MUDs based on open source codebases like DIKU, Smaug, RoM, CircleMUD, and many others. Burning began as modified DIKU, but has been heavily modified over the years, and is now mostly unique.

      * MUDs generally provide a depth of content beyond what graphical games can offer. As the content is simpler to create, more can be generated. This generally means more areas, more items, more monsters, more quests, and more things to do.

      * MUDs can be played on any computer, even a phone or tablet.

      * Hosting costs are much more affordable with MUDs. A single older PC could host a MUD if needed, while a modern MMO can require hundreds of powerful servers. This means that MUDs can be run by individuals, and are not beholden to a company or corporation.

      * On a MUD, everyone exists and plays together in the same world. No "sharding" or "instancing" is required to balance performance. This means that you can play with your friends, and not be separated by arbitrary server boundaries.

      * To create content on a MUD you just need to use your imagination, and any computer will work. In a graphical MMO, new content is difficult, costly and time consuming to create.

      * MUDs only limitation graphically is your imagination, and they never age visually. Graphics age and become outdated. MUDs are timeless like a good book.

      Burning MUD has a unique multi-classing system where you select a second class after gaining mastery over the first class. Your character becomes a mix of the two classes, allowing interesting combinations of powerful abilities. Pick opposites like the Mage/Fighter to have a broad range of abilities, or narrow your focus instead and choose Mage/Mage to gain highly specialized spells and skills. There are over 64 different combinations, including classics such as the Fighter, Priest, Mage, and Rogue, as well as more exotic options Warlock, Nightblade, Animist, and Templar. Nearly any combination of two classes is possible, while the first class will weigh more heavily in defining your character.

      Burning MUD is a heavily modified Diku codebase with a mostly original medieval fantasy world that brings a unique flavor to the genre of text-based MMO games. Burning contains a massive planet spanning two continents separated by a deep ocean, and lurking beneath the bustling surface of the planet's crust lies an extensive expanse of procedurally generated underground caverns, called the Well.

      The Well, an expansive underground cave system, leading 20 levels deep with thousands of rooms, reaveals countless mythical creatures and deadly environmental traps as one ventures deeper underground. Each day, the caverns are reshaped by these environmental forces such as lava flows, bringing surprises and unending threats to the intrepid adventurers who dare to explore the perilous depths. But risk is not without reward, for one will find that the creatures are imbued with the magic of these baffling caverns, leaving behind fragments of elemental energy that grant unimaginable powers of an eternal and ancient race.
