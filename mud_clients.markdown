# Windows MUD Clients

[Mudlet](https://www.mudlet.org/) - Newer client for Windows. If you are unfamiliar with MUDs, this may be a good starting place.<br />
[ZMUD](https://www.zuggsoft.com/) - Legacy paid client for Windows.<br />

# Telnet / SSH Clients (PC)
[TinyFugue (tf)](https://tinyfugue.sourceforge.net/) - A client for Linux<br />
[PuTTy](https://putty.org/) - Telnet / SSH Client for Windows<br />
    * Connect directly to BurningMUD via Telnet protocol. PuTTy itself does not support triggers.<br />
    * Connect to a Linux SSH server where TinyFugue client is hosted.
[TinTin++](https://tintin.mudhalla.net/) - Legacy client for Linux or Windows (WinTin++)<br />

# Mobile Clients

# Triggers
In fast-paced action MUDs, it can sometimes be hard to keep up with how much text appears on the screen! We try to help the player filter out some information optionally through the [Gags](help.markdown) system, which allows a player to filter out incoming text that doesn't affect them directly.
[Uzi](https://github.com/tollofsen/uzi) - An extensive trigger set designed for Tinyfugue, exclusively for Burning MUD.<br />
    * Author: Moe<br />
    * Maintainer: Brutus<br />

# Telnet Protocol
Finally, if you don't want to install anything, you can always stop by using a Telnet client @ burningmud.com, port 4000.<br />
[Connect to BurningMUD using Telnet protocol](telnet://burningmud.com:4000)<br />
