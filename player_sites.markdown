# Player Sites

The world of Burning is massive and consists of two continents, with an innumerable amount of dark pathways and villainous creatures. As you progress and become more powerful, danger begins to lurk behind every corner and spring from every shadow. It is not easy to survive without some help, whether that is from informational sources like maps, or grouping up with other players to heal and protect each other.

Some extremely talented individuals have put together accurate text maps of almost every corner of the game! As well as assistance in navigation, look up known item stats, learn how to complete quests, and find general strategic and gameplay advice!

Impressive to say the least, and everyone benefits from their dedication to uncovering the secrets of the game. If you see these players around the game, make sure to thank them for their amazing work, and for choosing to share it with everyone so generously!

If you would like to submit your website to be listed here, please contact an immortal in-game or at the support email address, found in the [Help](/help.markdown) page.
