# Player Sites

The world of Burning is massive and consists of two continents, with an innumerable amount of dark pathways and villainous creatures. As you progress and become more powerful, danger begins to lurk behdind every corner and spring from every shadow. It is not easy to survive without some help, whether that is informational like maps, or grouping up with other players to heal and protect each other.

Some extremely talented individuals have spent a lot of hard work putting together accurate text maps of pretty much every corner of the game! Find assistance in navigation, look up known item stats, learn how to complete quests, and find general advice!

Impressive to say the least, and everyone benefits from their dedication to uncovering the secrets of the game. If you see these players around the game, make sure to thank them for their amazing work!
