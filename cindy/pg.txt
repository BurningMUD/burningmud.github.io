!!! PG GUIDE !!!

=======================================================

Followers' guide:

This note is for all newbies, ie 95% of the people on the mud (won't
say 95% of people reading this, because only 5% of the ones who needs
it actually reads help files).

* Bring a BOAT, bring a BOAT, bring a BOAT!!!
There is no need to waste priests' mana by having to ask for summon because
the group walked over some water, or leader's time by returning and trying
to find an ak mage to cast fly on you.

* Set second in Myrridon. If it's your first trip to NC (NC=New Continent.
You will notice when going there by grouptells about NC, waiting by a
shore, boarding a ship and then standing still for some time while the
boat takes you to the other continent) TELL the leader that you haven't
been there before and he will hopefully help you set that place as
second hometown. Second hometown means that whenever you are in NC and
recall, you will end up in the Myrridon temple. If you haven't set
hometown, you will recall to Karandras.

* Bring a BOAT!

* LISTEN to the leader. OBEY the leader. What he says is the LAW!
Don't try to smalltalk with the leader. He's busy leading.
It might be a good thing to have a trigger on "<Groupleader> tells the
group, 'enter/drink Xxx'". That way he won't have to wait for you to
get back to the screen when going to certain areas / fighting certain
mobs.

* Bring a BOAT!

* Anchor means a guy who stays behind so people who die/contingency/gets
teleported/... has some means to get back. The anchor is usually a priest,
since he can "summon" you back. In some cases the anchor needs to do a bit
more than just stay put and summon. Against Malius he'll have to take over the
leadership and against Master Brain he has to create a gate.

* Do NOT use single-spells in wild-magic rooms. Try to learn where these
rooms are. There aren't really that many.

* Teaming up to wither a mob: If you are a priest, find another priest in the
group to team up with. Make sure this person KNOWS that you two are working
together. Also make sure the group knows you are teamed up (You don't want the
summoner to get lagged because others are using him for spells).
Decide who is summoner and ho is witherer. Make sure the summoner is ready to
summon. The witherer then moves into the room with the mob, tells the
summoner "summon" and casts "wither" on the mob. IN THAT ORDER! Wither gives
you a 10 second waitstate, so telling the priest "summon" after you've cast
your spell means you
 a) didn't need to be summoned this time.
 b) are already dead.
Make sure these three commands (move, ask for summon, wither) are sent with no
delay. You can't type the commands by hand - you'll get summoned before you
manage to cast wither. Use script-alias or mud-alias. Or copy the three
commands into a buffer and paste them into the shell.

* To get to the group, if it's not in Karandras, dimdoor (if you are a mage)
or ask a priest. If unsure, ask someone in the group where the group is.
You can't get summons to a different continent, into Apocalypse, DarkSpawn,
Underworld and some other places.
Before asking for a summon back into a battle who's killed several people,
check on "where" first. Telling a priest who just died "summon" means you
will just get summoned to sfs, spending valuable priest mana.
Also, try to see if the group is at recall. If so, you don't need to
ask for summon to get to the group.

* Bring a BOAT!

* If blinded, wait a little before complaining. Priests _should_ gheal after
fights against mass-blinding mobs. Unfortunately nobody does, but some leaders
actually asks the priests for groupheals when people get blinded.

* If we are resting and you have full mana and heal ability, _spend_ some of
that mana to heal someone. If you are highest level in the group and have
access to the armor spell, cast it on the tank, rogues & nightblades. Casting
regenerate on non-priest spellcasters, group blessing, recasting holyword,
spelling up yourself,... Never hurts to do if you have full mana.

* Turn OFF autoloot, but keep autogold ON. ALWAYS have autosplit ON.

* Try to stay with the group. If you need to recall to buy onions/etc, do it
fast.

* Bring enough recall stuff to last you the whole pg. If you _do_ run out of
them, try recalling the "normal" way before asking for summons to get to town.

* Bring a BOAT!

And finally...
BRING A BOAT!!!

Leaders' guide:

This is how the information is given:
The mobs are listed and sorted by area name (but divided into OC and NC
areas). For each area there is a header, then the mob list and finally any
area specific information.
Directions are given only in a few, special cases. If you can't find the mob,
or have trouble even finding the area, LEARN! EXPLORE! A PG leader should not
have to ask for directions during the PG. Having speedies helps, but if you
don't have any clue about the area it doesn't help if I give you the exact
path and exact do:s and dont:s - you will still fail!


Header info:
<area name>: The name of the area
Lvl: Mob level
A  : Alignment (G/N/E)
S  : Sanc ("x" if sanced, "-" if not)
W  : Walking ("x" if walking, "-" if not)
I  : Detect invis (x/-)
D  : Sees in darkness (x/-)
M  : Memory (x/-)
agg: Aggressive (G/- N/- E/-). "G-E" means aggressive to good & evil, but not
     to neutral. "G -" means aggressive to good, not aggressive to evil and no
     knowledge about neutrals.
Hp : Hitpoints. Given as range when possible. "873-1013" means the mob can
     have as low as 873 and as high as 1013 hitpoints. NOTE: The range may be
     wider (hard to know maxhp without killing the mob hundreds of times).
     A "~" preceeding the hp means that this is just an estimation.
Gold: How much gold the mob has

Mob list info:
Spec: Any special information about the mob, like vulnerabilities,
      resistances, if it's an info mob (INFO), what spells it casts 
      (powerblind, mass pain), etc.
Info: Good-to-know about the mob
Eq  : Sometimes omitting non-important items
Size: Number of people needed (assuming "normal" group and giving a fair
      chance to kill). Note that a size 20 mob might be soloable or might
      slaughter a size 40 group, depending on the group composition). I'm
      guessing quite a lot here.

Spec:
Info: The area around Tix drains moves, and corpses fall into DT:s after a
      very short time. You might need fly, not sure. Doesn't hurt to give
      everyone some revitalize-herbs, but that will only help AK players.
      Better get some staves of revitalizing (oak staff), to make sure the
      whole group is revitalized before you move. Also, it might be good to
      ask others to help you loot too, so the corpse doesn't get lost before
      you get tó loot it. Unprepared, this area will ruin your day. If going
      for Tix, you might want to have a mage locate "phase". Phase spiders in
      that vincinity can have Phase spider leggings, which is a really nice ac
      piece.
Eq  : Orb of twilight, Spider-shaped pendant, Spider-webbed wrist guard,

Size: 35
AREA: To enter the area you have to enter the tree in Enchanted Forest (agg
      evil druid just inside), then go all the way down and "drink well",
      which blinds you and takes you to the area. The whole area is Nosum

      wither him first. Have a mage powerblind him and then let the priests do
      their work. If Solus flails he may summon molochs that will need to be
      killed before resuming. He may also powerheal, in which case a new
      powerblind may be needed (depending on if powerheal cures blindness for
      mobs). When fighting him, priests should use gheal and NOT gpow, since
      Solus has mass wither. And magic users should use area spells since he
      summons molochs.

Spec: INFO, shrugger, cloudkill-on-death
Info: To get to Oceanos you need a coral key. The key is on one of the other
      gods, but when killed will move to another one of them. Just kill all of
      them and you'll get it.
Eq  : ring of the Titans, leggings of the seven seas, gigantic maul from

Size: 35
AREA: Most of (the whole?) underwater part of this area is norecall, but you
      can summon people there. This makes withering mobs a pain. If priests
      can't be summoned after casting wither (try if it's possible) you will
      need to use wither scrolls.

Spec:
Info: Does REALLY nasty damage and summons giants to help him. Prepare for
      mass deaths. Cleaning up in all dirs around him and having a copper in
      each room around him while preparing is a good idea. So is wither, I
      think. Massive area damage is a must!

Spec:
Info: Raven bracelets is the important piece on him. Nolocate, so if you can
      get a rogue to sneak off and have a peek at him, it may save you a lot
      of trouble.
Eq  : raven feather bracelet, spear "Gungner", the eye of Odin
Size: 30
AREA: The area is crowded with ice & fire giants with auras. They aren't
      aggressive, but their auras pulse out damage, so when standing next to
      one, you will be fighting within a second. These giants die fast, but
      they do nasty damage for as long as they stand. Peeker & tracker is very
      useful here.

Snake Lair:              Lvl ASWIDM agg     Hp        Gold    Special
AREA: Probably more suitable for a heavy xp group than for PG. Kill enough
      snakes here (a LOT! Cleaning out the area isn't enough. You'll have to
      do it several times) and their mommy will come to stop you. She's got a
      key to a white snakeskin belt

Eq  : small wizard ring, giant-sized cloud mail, The Cloudblade, bag of Power

AREA: A few locked doors, not sure if they are pickable. Guards have key for
      the entrance gate and some captains have keys for the others. 2 steps up
      in the tower are 2-5 commanders (usually 5). Aggressive lvl 60 mobs that
      does some nice damage, so a few rounds of area spells and some quick
      healing is helpful here. Goluk is nearby and a cake mob, if you feel it
      s worth losing an extra 10 seconds.

Info: If you get calmed, the only thing you are able to do seems to be to

      anyway and once dead you will be back to normal again.

Spec: INFO, invis, vuln slay human
Info: 
Eq  : traitor's cowl, Ancient Shield, boots of arch-sorcery
Size: 30
AREA: Jedah will have the power of every embodiment still alive, so ill them
      first. And make sure the area hasn't respawned when going for the big
      ones. Kill Surak last, since he can teleport your weapons a few rooms
      away and even into the Traitor's room. If this happens (or worse, if
      the Traitor picks up the weapon), it's good to know that he's your next
      target. The path for these mobs (starting at the centre, 2e2n-enter
k      portal from Atuan) are:
        s-portal-s-portal-KILL Celebros-portal
        e-portal-d-w-KILL Saeros-e-portal-u-portal
        e-portal-u-KILL Vidir-e-portal-n-e-KILL Uldor-w-s-portal
        w-portal-KILL Telemar-portal-u-e-portal-e-d-KILL Surak-u-e-u
      From here, you have the Traitor north. If you enter the portal instead
      you will be back at the centre.
      After killing the Traitor and looting his Celestial Key, use the key to
      get past the door in Elven Village, killing the mobs and looting the
      Ethereal key from the chest there (plus 5M cash).
      From that chest, go: portal-w-portal-portal-u-e-portal-e-e-u-n
      to get back to the Traitor's room. To make sure you don't mess this up
      and have to take the long trip (and to reduce the risk of area pop),
      have someone follow self and wait for you south of the Traitor room.

AREA: Large area with lots of fun things! Great fun place to explore, even if
      you can't get very far inside alone due to the removal of the Varak-Ki
      entrance. Tons of keys (36), so I decided to make a walkthrough for this
      one:
      * Get to the Ofcol Obelisk
      * 2w2n, kill gatekeeper, loot key, unlock gate
      * 5n, kill doorguard, loot key, unlock door
      * 3n2e2n (past aggies)
      * open east, east, get key, west
      * 2s2wn (past aggies)
      * By now you should have bumped into and killed the Dungeon Keeper. If
        not he's probably just one step down from you, so go kill and loot his
        key.
      * up, kill armor, up, north
      * This is a square:ish area. You need 2 keys here. One from a Ghost
        servant and one from a Ghoulish Guard. To cover the whole area here,
        go 2w2en2w2en2s3en2wn2en4wsnen2e and kill & loot everyone you see.
      * open door east, east, kill & loot if anything here, 3w
      * OPTIONAL: open door west, 2w, kill the Black & White guardians here
                  and loot keys, open (unlock?) door south, south, loot chest 
                  has crown of Sokar, heart of Rathark & ring of Evos), n2e
      * 5s2u, kill aggie, n2e2n, open door west, west, kill mobs and loot key
      * e2s4wn, open door east, east, kill mobs and loot key
      * wn, open door east, east, kill mobs and loot key
      * w2n2e, kill 2 mobs and loot key
      * unlock door south, south, kill mob, loot key
      * open door west, west, kill if anyone there, east
      * open door east, east, kill if anyone there, west
      * OPTIONAL: open door south, south, kill & loot Garlok's ghost, open
                  door south, south, kill & loot King Torsak, 2n
      * n2w, unlock door west, west
      * 12u (kill mobs in your path and loot - one key should be found)
      * unlock door north, north, kill Tower Guardian, loot key
      * s12d5e, unlock door east, east
      * 12u (kill mobs in your path and loot - one key should be found)
      * unlock door north, north, kill Tower Guardian, loot key
      * s12dw4s, unlock door east, east
      * 12u (kill mobs in your path and loot - one key should be found)
      * unlock door north, north, kill Tower Guardian, loot key
      * s12d5w, unlock door west, west
      * 12u (kill mobs in your path and loot - one key should be found)
      * unlock door north, north, kill Tower Guardian, loot key
      * s12d3es5d, unlock door south, south
      * cells east & west. Enter both & kill & loot, then go one south (repeat
        4 times). All these cells are "OPTIONAL"
      * OPTIONAL: open cell east, east, kill & loot, west
      * open door south, south, kill troll, loot key, north (Note: Troll is a
        blocker and the room is norecall).
      * unlock door west, west, unlock door west, west
      * unlock door down, down (repeat 4 times)
      * OPTIONAL: 2nw2n, kill rockworm, loot, 2se2s
      * 3d (mobs here? If so, kill & loot)
      * unlock door west, west, 2d, kill 2 guards here & loot.
      * 5w (past aggies)

                  kill Blue Dragon, loot, u7wnwd3n
      * 6w, pick gate west, 3w
      * You will need to find & kill the Watch commander now. If you want to
        get the Fire sword you will also want to find & kill So'rak. Both are
        nearby but walking. If you know your way around, just go kill. If not,
        I'd suggest using a rogue to track them down and then have him track
        Kraken. Once you get to the locked grate down, go to next paragraph.
        From where this paragraph started, the grate is 2n3ws2w (past a few
        doors).
      * unlock grate down, d3w
      * north, kill Kraken, loot
      * s2enu2en3e2s4w (may be aggies & doors on the way)
      * OPTIONAL: en, open door north, 2n, kill & loot Fire Demon (I think he
                  is here, at least), 3sw
      * OPTIONAL: 2wnwden, kill & loot, get Fire sword, unlock door west,
                  wsues2e. Do NOT do this unless you have So'rak's fire key,
                  or you will get stuck in the fire room.
      * 2n3wu (from here on you may encounter walking aggresive guards)
      * OPTIONAL: east, open door south, south, open door east, kill & loot
                  Castelain, wnw
                  NOTE: Castelain's key is needed for some of the optionals
                        below. These are marked "C OPTIONAL".
      * C OPTIONAL: 2en, open door south, kill & loot red mage, n3w

      equipped with healing staves, so they can heal themselves then use their
      staff to heal everyone (so people get unblinded and can follow the
      leader again). Also, you might want to have a 2:nd leader to take group
      if you should drop when entering the room (or just get back to Nyx
      fast). This place usually kills all afk:ers except the ones lucky enough
      to be teleported, so try to get the group ak for this one.

Info: Since ultra-hidden, everyone will need to use area to join. Room is
      noflee. Might be good top ask mages to create a few areadamage-scrolls
      so rogues and anyone without areadamage can join.  And turn off rescues,

Spec: INFO, vuln slay mythical?, invis, 1-2 backstab
Info: To get past door to Hades, you need to have 3 people "touch door" in the
      right order: nb/nb, te/te, neutral leader (lvl 55+). Hades switches
      between Left Hades & Right Hades, who must be killed before the Real
      Hades can be fought.
      The Left Hades is vuln fire, immune ice
      The Right Hades is vuln ice, immune fire
      Both are invis, cast triad of fire twice per round and can shrug spells.
      Hades will have a key that leads to 2 rooms, but the key dissolves when
      used, so only one room can be tried. If Tisiphone has been killed, one
      of these rooms has the robe of blood. I know of no way to find out which
      room is the right one.

Info: Hurts quite bad, especially if you let the number of gloom ravens build
      up (lvl 54-59, 3501 hp, vuln slay human). Not sure about those shadow
      fiends. Good area damage and good healing is important.

Spec: summon mirror images of everyone entering
Info: For every person entering the room, a shadow mage/fighter/... of the
      same level appeared, to help Ghanz. The old way of taking this guy was
      to bring in a few select people at a time. Nowadays it's standard to
      just gtell AREA a few times and then walk in. And it usually works. If
      you need to rest up, do it in the room with the last mobs, NOT just
      outside Ghanz (nomag and no way back). A few rounds of heavy area damage
      and heavy healing is enough to clean things up, and then Ghanz himself
      will be quite easy to handle. Once killed, loot the chest west of him 
      (only evil-aligned people can do this)
Eq  : unholy bracelet, Wrathbringer, burning crucifix (key). Chest has ebony

Shadow                         95+ Nxxx   GNE           5000001-5000001
Spec: INFO, hide, walk-path, mort-special, force you to hit friends
Info: Hidden, so you want people with damage-auras to have them turned on,
      and everyone that can't see hidden needs to use area attack to join.
      A smaller king (lvl 77-79) is just above Shadow's hideout, so (due to
      the auras) kill him first.
      Shadow has a special that makes you start hitting on friends. This is no
      problem for spell casters, since they do less melee damage and their
      spells still go on the shadow, but pure fighters will just cause
      trouble, so keep their number to a minimum (ask people to switch to
      spellsrs if they can).
      He moves in a path only he can walk (4 steps, I think) and is only
      reachable in one of these rooms. When in any of the other rooms, he will
      regenerate, so it might be a good idea to poison him. He is immune to
      wither. To poison him, you need someone to sneak in and blind
      him when he is in the room where you can reach him. And then you need
      people to poison him. Hard & dangerous, but may be well worth the effort
      if you are a smaller group.
      Another special he has is to put people at -9 hp, which is bad. And even
      worse when followed by an area attack. Priest healing is very important
      here! I believe he also has a special that kills you instantly.
      No matter what group you have, your possibility to kill this guy without
      a single player death is close to nill, but since the shadow moves
      around you will have time now and then to get your group in order again.
      Normal tactic is to keep a summoner as anchor above the shadow's room. A
      half-priest is probably best, since pure-priests will be needed in the
      fight. Safest way of handling this is to give group to the anchor, wait
      until shadow is NOT in his room, have the anchor go down (bringing the
      group) and "leave up" (leaving the group there). When people die they
      can get summoned back by the anchor, and by following him they'll be
      back in the group again.
      When shadow is in the room, give him your worst! When shadow is not in
      the room, gossip to your dead team mates to GET BACK so group can heal
      up and prepare for when he gets back. As PG leader you are probably a
      good tank - it might be a bonus if you leave the room and go back in, so
      you become the "last" person in the room, as that is whom the shadow
      will attack when he returns.

      kill him or die!

      anchor again, and this time he will die.
      When looking for Malius, he will take on the shape of one of the other
      npc:s in this area, but will not look exactly the same, so if you
      highlight his descriptions, you can recognize him without having to look
      at every npc. The descriptions he will have are (in random order):

      to NC and ask some KTV:s to take the Milorai shortcut and find it while
      you're on the boat. That way you can go from the boat (all rested) and

      spells to join. And the mobs around are random-agg and has memory.
      Therefore I suggest cleaning up those low-level mobs nearby to make the
      Nerfarim-kill swifter (because he flees a lot). When Nerfarim flees he
      does NASTY damage, so you don't want to mess about too much once he
      starts running around.

      need the bonus you get from wither (I'd suggest to use poison too).
      Since he is aggressive, you need mages to create powerblind scrolls and
      some sneeker to get in and use them before priests can start their work.
      Since he is a shrugger, you will need several of these scrolls. And
      since he trueheals you should be prepared to powerblind him again. If
      pblind is close to running out, any mage can go in and recast pblind,
      but if he flails and trueheals... maybe he'll stay blind now, since
      trueheals shouldn't heal blindness/wither. If so, the wither gives you a
      great bonus when fighting him. Also, you can make tipis in the rooms
      nearby, giving several people (witherers/pblinders) a chance to regen at
      the same time.

Elder-Brain
Spec: vuln mental
Info: Appears after you've killed some smaller brain. The elder-brain charms
      people, having them work against you, so you will need to set up an
      anchor that stays d2n from the reception. This MUST be a Pr/Pr, and MUST
      be the same one that sets up the gate d2n from reception (that should
      lead to the brain - make sure it's not a bad gate). When someone gets
      charmed, that person MUST recall, then go 8w2su, rent, get back in, go
      d2n, follow the anchor, make SURE he gets grouped and then enter the
      field to get back in the fight. If the one setting up the gate dies, the
      gate will stop working, so the Pr/Pr creating the gate can NOT join the
      fight and thus makes the best choulce of also being the anchor. With a
      good team of ak players, a lot less people is needed to kill him. And
      with poor leader and/or afk players, even a group of 50 will get
      slaughtered. If this is your first PG, don't bother trying this guy.

Spec: vuln pure/light/iron
Info: His room is norecall and has no exits, except a pile of bones you can
      enter (NOT when fighting). This takes you back to oc, so do NOT go here
      unless you want to get back to oc (if you do want to get back to oc this
      is an excellent, fast shortcut to get there). If you fail to kill him
      you will ALL die (except, maybe, people who retreat and enter bones), so
      don't just "give it a try".

AREA: Castle Paravel has an old king plus the 4 current rulers (Peter, Susan,
      Edmund & Lucy). Their eq is decent, so probably worth killing them too,
      since they are so easy preys. Edmund seems to have no eq, so you can
      skip him. Most of the mobs here has WAY more hp than normal mobs at the
      same level (pegasus is lvl 66 and has 24k hp, which is comparable to
      mobs of lvl 80-85. Lvl 66 mobs usually has around 6k hp). So expect some
      fights to be longer than expected, but not nessecarily harder. Goot area
      to finish your NC tour with, since it has a speedie to OC

      their Lord, and if killed they just reappear. So everyone should make
      sure to cast their spells on "Lord" and switch to him if possible
      ("target Lord")
      Hmm... Possible to blind the heads before attacking Azimer? Is it
      possible (are they blindable and can one do it and escape)? Will it
      help (I think David helps Dick even if blinded, but protect-the-innocent
      code may differ from the rescue code)?

Takhisis
Spec:
Info: Only mages can go to the tower where Takhisis (Kiki) is. Others take
      damage when trying, losing 45-90% maxhp. It doesn't have to be a pure
      mage. When inside, a smaller mob (Dalamar) is one step up and then a
      bigger one (Raistlin Majere) is u-n from him. From there, you need a
      good-aligned pr/pr and an evil aligned ma/ma to open the gate (NOT sure
      about class and aligns). Entering will give you a short waitstate, and
      it's possible that you can't bring the whole group. For whatever reason,
      it's standard to have a fighter enter and then a priest gate to him.
      Then make sure that the portal is good, and enter with the group. This
      fight is a LONG one, so you should bring some planks/rocks and build an
      outpost IN the room with Kiki and tell people to retreat and enter this
      outpost when they are low on mana. Kiki has 5 heads with different
      vulns, which shifts pretty often. My suggestion here is to NOT gtell 
      use xxx" when the head changes, since it will make people spend most of
      their time just switching weapons (even worse if you get lagged
      yourself, when giving such orders). Instead tell them to be AK and just
      gtell "fire", "ice", etc when the head changes and let people decide for
      themselves if they want to change (this is just a suggestion - I'm
      turning off weapon switches here so if you want to force people to switch
      weapons it won't bother me). The most important thing is to make sure to
      tell people to "heal her" when she has the purple head (immune to
      weapon, takes damage only from healing spells). This head is the one
      that drains priests and makes the outpost so valuable. The string for
      changing head is:
           The eyes of the <COLOR> head glow with a ...
      ...and the colors you will encounter are:
           purple: HEAL (immune weapon)
           blue  : FIRE
           red   : ICE
           green : UNLIFE
           orange: ENERGY
      All heads apart from the purple one are vulnerable to slay dragon, so
      probably best if people stick to such a weapon.
      Once all heads are dead, things get real nasty. Kiki will start hitting
      hard and use specials that puts people at -9 hp. Priests will be needed
      even more now. If priests are somewhat ak and smart, they will make
      sure (during the whole battle) that there's always some outside to keep
      group healthy, and some in the outpost regenning mana. If not, it's your
      job to organize things.
      If everyone leaves room, Kiki will regenerate her heads. Might be enough
      that leader leaves the room. But it is possible, once all heads are down,
      to blind her, retreat and order everyone else to recall, thus ending
      battle. Then, if you sleep her or keep her blind, you can bring group
      back and have everybody regenerate before taking on that last form.

      Bad way: Kill the black knight first, having mages waste all their mana
      for no use. Then attack the silver paladin and watch how he doesn't die
      as your fighters keep missing and your mages have too little mana to do
      any real harm to him.
