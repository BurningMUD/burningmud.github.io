MUD, what's it all about?
=========================
MUD = Multi User Dungeon
This is a text adventure in a fantasy setting where you control your hero.
Burning MUD is a fantasy world with towns, dungeons, oceans, deserts, forests,
and other imaginary and unimaginary environments. It is inhabited by a great
variety of creatures - anything from rabbits to dragons, or from kids running
around in the towns, to evil overlords in their castles, raising armies of
undeads.
You start in the capital city (Karandras), as a 17 year old person. You're a
newbie with no fighting experience, no money and no equipment. But you are
destined for greatness!
To become more powerful you will need equipment, skills and, in some cases,
spells.
Explore the world, find weapons, armors and other items that you can have use
for, kill monsters to gain experience, which will increase your "level",
making you more powerful.
In mud there is no storyline to follow and no end goal to reach. Your main
goal is to gain power, by raising levels, improving your equipment and
learning about the world. There are quests, but you decide what to do and
where to go.
You share this world with other users, so you can talk with them, trade items,
team up to kill a tougher monster together, etc.
Note: This is not a Player Killing mud! You can't kill other players nor be
killed by them.
Equipment is out there, worn by creatures just waiting for you to kill them
and grab their loot. There are also shops selling and buying items.
Skills and spells are taught by guildmasters. Each class has a guildmaster
that can train them. Training is instantaneous but costs practice points. You
start your carreer with five practice points, and each time you gain a new
level you will get some more.
Apart from a few quests limited to lowbies, and name/alignment/class/race being
permanent, there are no ways to go wrong. Any "bad" choices or misfortunes can
get sorted out in the end. And even some of the permanent things can be
changed.

 1- 7: Pixie forest     Don't attack any spell casters

25-38: Elven lands      Elven druid casts heal on you!
25-40: Caverns          Imp or darkness prefered
25-50: Hobgoblin camps  Max-enchant a wielded, forged fire-headed mace
30-45: DarkFriends
35-50: Venden           Try use misty transparent leash
35-50: Court
35-50: Mustaine
35-50: Alchor           Use unlife/poison/silver
40-50: Museum           Beware elite guards if you are evil
40-50: Orshingal
45-50: Shipwreck        Troll:Fire, Ghoul:Unlife, Rest:pure/light/silver
50-65: Argo             The trolls
55-60: Citadel
55-65: Antiriad         Use pure/light/fire

* I'd suggest concentrating on weapon damage at lower levels even if you're
  a pure mage, since mana runs out so fast. This means eq giving strength
  hitroll and damroll. For convenience, try boost con (hp), wis (practices)
  and int (spell-training) too. And a hp-boost is also great at low levels.
  Check the Lowbie_eq file for some ideas.
* Make sure to get an armor spell from a high-level player (ask any highbie
  that isn't pure rogue/righter "arm"). This improves your armor class tons
  more than a nice lowbie-ac-gear.
* Getting 1k xp every 5 seconds is better than getting 10k exp every other
  minute. Obvious but easily forgotten - every kill doesn't have to give
  great exp if you just kill fast enough.
* To get to 50/50 you only really need:
     1- 7: Pixie forest
     8-16: Humblin
    15-27: Muldorbrooke
    25-50: Hobgoblin camps
* Joining a group can bring you exp faster, but don't forget to enjoy the
  game yourself too.
* A charm person scroll can give you a nice pet. With some help you can
  order Foreman Floyd around when level 1.
* Area damage scrolls/staffs can help your exp rate a lot, if you can find
  good ones (vibrating?), good rooms (Karandras, Hightower or use summoners)
  and a good method (enter, tell priest summon, recite scroll).

* Any bonus exceeding max stat will be wasted, so if you don't need all the
  stats, switch some item to something else, more usable (other stat, hitroll
  or hp).
* At low levels it's pretty hard to hit your target, so hitroll is a lot more
  important than damroll.
* When having a light source you won't need darkvision. But if you eg switch
  your neck gear to ghostly chains (hr+1, ac-4, mv-15, DARK), you will bring
  darkness with you, which can help you avoid many aggressive mobs.
