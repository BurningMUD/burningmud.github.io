!!! EXP GUIDE !!!

=======================================================

Followers' guide:

This note is for all newbies, ie 95% of the people on the mud (won't
say 95% of people reading this, because only 5% of the ones who needs
it actually reads help files).

* Bring a BOAT, bring a BOAT, bring a BOAT!!!
There is no need to waste priests' mana by having to ask for summon because
the group walked over some water, or leader's time by returning and trying
to find an ak mage to cast fly on you.

* "who group" will list available groups. The first player listed is the
leader. His title will often hint about whether you are welcome to join
or not. Eg:
ask:       Ask leader if you may join.
DTFF:      Don't Tell, Find & Follow (just get to leader and follow him).
Lvl 80-:   You may join if you are max level 80
50/50+:    You may join if you are at least level 50/50
Merc only: Open only for members of that merc.
Closed:    No, you are not welcome to join
Normally you are expected to be at least level 50/50 to join.

* Bring a BOAT!

* To get to the group, if it's not in Karandras, dimdoor (if you are a mage)
or ask a priest. If unsure, ask someone in the group where the group is.
You can't get summons to a different continent, into Underworld, to the
Great Red Wyrm, to Waywatcher rooms and some other places.

* Bring a BOAT!

* Set second in Myrridon. If it's your first trip to NC (NC=New Continent.
You will notice when going there by grouptells about NC, waiting by a
shore, boarding a ship and then standing still for some time while the
boat takes you to the other continent) TELL the leader that you haven't
been there before and he will hopefully help you set that place as
second hometown. Second hometown means that whenever you are in NC and
recall, you will end up in the Myrridon temple. If you haven't set
hometown, you will recall to Karandras.

* Bring a BOAT!

* If blinded, wait a little before complaining. Priests _should_ gheal after
fights against mass-blinding mobs. Unfortunately nobody does, but some leaders
actually asks the priests for groupheals when people get blinded.

* If we are resting and you have full mana and heal ability, _spend_ some of
that mana to heal someone. If you are highest level in the group and have
access to the armor spell, cast it on the tank, rogues & nightblades. Casting
regenerate on non-priest spellcasters, group blessing, recasting holyword,
spelling up yourself,... Never hurts to do if you have full mana.

* Turn OFF autoloot, but keep autogold ON. ALWAYS have autosplit ON.

* Try to stay with the group. If you need to recall to buy onions/etc, do it
fast.

* Bring enough recall stuff to last you the whole pg. If you _do_ run out of
them, try recalling the "normal" way before asking for summons to get to town.

* Bring a BOAT!

And finally...
BRING A BOAT!!!


=======================================================
=======================================================

Leaders' guide:

Tips:
* Many people will follow you if you just tell them "exp" (don't expect all
  of them to be 100% ak, though).
* If you have a high level purepriest, have him cast group armor (ask "garm"
  or tell "agarm").
* Any purepriest can cast group bless (ask "gbless" or tell "agbless")
* Any priest can cast holy, so best to set a halfpriest on it (tell "aholy")
* Puremages can cast magic carpet (ask "gfly" or tell "agfly")
* Puremages can cast group invisibility (ask "gimp" - useful eg when passing
  the marsh on the way to Citadel of Order)
* If fighting a mob that blinds, ask for a gheal after the fight.
* If fighting a mob that withers, ask for a gpow after the fight.
* Might be a good idea to _not_ be invisible/dark, to make sure you don't
  run past aggies, leaving someone to battle them alone. Use gimp if needed.
* Try to spread the priest-settings, to reduce the risk of everyone healing
  the same person at the same time. Ghp-heals is usually more drainy than
  thp-heals, so if you have more than one purepriest, you can eg set the best
  one (with regen) to thp 50, ghp 60, and the other one to thp 60, ghp 50. 
* It's probably a good idea to consider using ghostly spear as energy-weapon
  and get your followers to do likewise. It can be stabbed with by rogues
  but doesn't deal "PIERCE" damage, so can be used against the Solom ghosts.
  And if everyone (most) people uses it, then it can be used against other
  pierce-immune mobs too, even if they aren't vulnerable to energy (making
  sure all the rogues can help out).
* Best would be if everyone could add a new weapon type - plain, that didn't
  have any specials. Then that could be used against any mob with weird
  resistances/immunities (bloody dagger for rogues and the 15-thronged whip
  for non-rogues are perfect plain-weapons. If you can't do damage with them,
  then no other weapon will work either).
* Some priests have popcheck-scripts to help you figure out which areas have
  respawned (pop:ed). Try grouptelling "popcheck oc" to see if anyone has it.
  Syntax and response can vary. If several has this trigger, try using tell
  instead of grouptell, to get just one response. The most commonly used
  targets to check pop on are oc/nc/medjai/drow/uw/soulies, but others exist.

Common courtesy (imo):
* If someone dies, MAKE SURE he gets his corpse back! Many people have spent
  months and even years to get their eq.
* Expect some people to be afk. You are still responsible for them. If you
  don't like it, ditch whoever shows to be afk (in a SAFE place. And just tell
  them they're welcome back once they get ak again).
* Don't go up against mobs that normally kill people, unless you have a big
  group consensus. Many people joining exp are there for exp - not to risk
  their lives.
* The followers aren't there for your personal gain. If you take a group and
  only kill a couple of eq-mobs, roll ALL the eq. As a leader, it's ok to take
  a leadpick, but then you're expected to lead some exp too. And even if you
  do lead some exp, it doesn't allow you to risk peoples lives, just so you
  can leadpick a power-item.
* If people keep failing to recall, I see no problem in ditching them (once
  summoned to FS). Same if you lose people because they aren't having a boat.
  Just ditch and tell them they're welcome back once they've fixed whatever
  they are lacking.


Healing:
Priest healings aren't too easy to understand. This is what (I believe) their
different abbreviations mean, and how to handle them:
-> grouptell status
...and you might get something like this:
(group)Cd is set to, 'Tank: Sue, mhp: 10% thp: 60% ghp: 60% gphp: 75%(4) dHEAL
 Off (uzi 1.41)
Tank: Is set to "Sue". Usually the leader, but could be a non-leader who is
      starting every attack (because leader is too puny), or a rescuer.
      He's the one expected to take the most damage.
mhp:  MiraHealPercent! If tank gets below this, priest will cast mira on him.
      Have it set low - normally to kick in only in case of emergency.
thp:  TankHealPercent! If tank gets below this, priest will cast true on him.
ghp:  GroupHealPercent! If a groupmember gets below this, priest will true him.
gphp: GroupPowerHealPercent! If X groupmembers gets below this (X being the
      number in parentheses), priest will cast a gpow. Useful when fighting
      many opponents.
dHEAL:Dynamic healing. Heal at higher percentage when high on mana and lower
      when low on mana. Normally considered crap, but quite useful if handled
      correctly. Don't bother with this unless you understand it.

To change any percentage, use tell. Eg "tell <priest> thp 60".
Good standard values, if only one priest, see the example above.
For two priests, set the "best" priest (with regen, otherwise highest level)
to thp-50, ghp-60, and the other one to thp-60, ghp-50 (ghp is normally more
drainy than thp).
Note: It's good if priests have different values, or they will both heal the
same person at the same time, causing overhealing and inefficiency.

Trueheal costs 80 mana and gives one person a double-powerheal.
Gpow costs 150 mana and gives everyone a powerheal.
So if 4 people needs healing, a gpow will heal as much as two trueheals,
slightly cheaper and at half the time.
Personally, I like having gphp set to 75% on the "best" priest.

The lower your numbers are, the less overhealing you will have: If someone
has 2k hp, it's good if he is below 50% before he gets a +1k hp trueheal.
But you don't want them so low that people die. Deaths are always inefficient.
A tank with 5k hp can have thp at 80% with almost no overhealing. No need
to keep the tank permanently low on hp (just increases the risk of him dying).

Stick to the basics in the beginning. If a priest gets drained too fast, or
stays at 100% while the rest goes down, you can try modifying the numbers.
After a while you might get a feeling for it, and find your own preferred
settings.

Finally, if priests are full, let next area be a drainy one. If priests are
getting low, let next area be a less drainy one. Save one drainy area, to
clear last, before taking the boat to the other continent (unless you can
jump between the continents).

Note: Most soulcrushers move around (sneaking). Only the aggressive (angry)
      and mystical ones are standing still.
      Soulcrushers assist each other. Only exception is the aggressive ones,
      on bottom floor, who aren't assisted by anyone. If more than one
      soulcrusher in the same room, you can always skip them and return a bit
      later, and they might have spread out.
      Angry & mystical soulcrushers may spawn badly if not all are killed,
      causing more than one to appear in the same room.

Note: Guards might have life-items (sleeves, gauntlets, boots, etc). Have
      a mage "cast 'locate object' life", and you'll know if the guards are
      worth killing (not worth killing for just exp).


Underworld: (soldiers, members & gods)

gtell use dark

Note: Whole area is nosummon/norecall, which is why you have to walk back.

gtell use slay dragon
swnswesn2en2snw3sw2ewswesw2ewn3en2snesnes2nsw3nw2ewnewne2wes4wn

Kaltor: (charred skeletons)
=======
> Get to Elemental Canyon

> skeletons (skip the two southernmost rooms with Balgroth & Kaltar):
sd4s2n2eswsw2ese2s2wes2w2e2nwnwesw2sw2nwne2newswn2w2ses2n
> Done!

Note: Charred skeletons move around, so there may be several in the same room.
      They are aggressive, and hit pretty hard. At least two purepriests is
      preferred, and you'd want to have 3k+ hitpoints as a leader, to handle
      walking into a room with 3 of them.
      If you feel unsafe, use a peeker.
      One of the skeletons is level 100 and info. He looks pretty much like the
      other skeletons, and is just a little tougher.


Amphitheatre: (grolims)
=============
> Get to Sundhaven
3e
open gate
3es2es3ese2n4w
gtell use iron
> Go through the whole area, one room at a time, killing all the aggressive
> grolim warrior priests (and the fanatic Grolim priests if you want).
> East side:
3n4e7n3wedw2e5s5w
> And back:
5e5nwu2e7s4w
> West side:
3w2ndnu4n2e2w4sd3newsd3s3e4nwe3s
> And bottom floor. Here is a high priest (vuln energy). He can be found in
> the northwest room, which can get nasty if there are other aggies with him.
dnswn

Note: Fanatic Grolim priests are not aggressive. If you attack them, be ready
      to toss a gheal after the fight, since they blind people.
      All priests (except high priest) move around.


Abandoned Caves: (deep ones, star spawns, proto)
================
> Get to Solace
7seu2nw4n3e3n3u6en
gtell use fire
> Find and kill Mor'balach (aggressive, vuln pure/light/fire/slay orc)
d3ew2s2w6n2esn2w2s2w2sew2s2w
> Get his key and get to the door in southwest (d2w2s2w from entrance).
unlock door
open door
drop key
gtell use normal
> Go through the whole area and kill all deep ones and star spawns.
13wne2sws2w4n2e2w2s
> Clear the rest of the area, includng 2 proto shoggoths
4e3nwnswes2enewnw
> If you feel lucky, and the pnakotic manuscripts is loaded, you can use
> the old parchment (a key) and go kill Shub-Niggurath:
> (unlock door, open door, 3nes)
> otherwise you're done.

Note: Deep ones and star spawns move around. Hunting horrors and proto
      shoggoths stand still (and the horrors aren't worth bothering with).
      This is not a great exp-area, but if elder sign is loaded, it'll give
      a decent item on the way.


Coven: (witches)
======
> Get to New Thalos
2enes
gtell use normal
2d2ed
> Kill all the witches in this, southeast, arm of the star:
wes2wsw3es2wese
> Then, take the shortcut to FS:
sus

Note: No known irv:s, and I'm fairly sure they don't have any.
      The priestess (sanced) casts area spells. Nothing terrifying.


Haon Dor: (trees)
=========
> Get to Karandras obelisk
10wn3wswswn9w
gtell use acid
> Go through the whole area, one room at a time, killing all trees except the
> oak one, which is tougher. Small, aggie wolves will attack here & there:
3w2new2s2e2s2wn2w2sws3wne3w2es3es2ewnensen2e2sw
> Done!

Note: Normal tree: A huge, ancient tree towers above you.
      Big tree:    A huge, ancient oak tree looks down on you from above.
      ....and the big one is also sanced. Not sure how much tougher it is.
      Also, beware of the DT! If you wee an up-exit, you have most likely
      managed to get into the Arachnos-area. DT is then just west of you.


Snake Lair: (wyrm + snakes)
===========
> Get to Enchanted Forest
> Go to the wyrm. A few tiny goats may attack you on your way:
3w
gtell use slay dragon
kill wyrm
> When he dies "get treasure" (700k gold). Loot his stuff if you like, but
> some items are cursed. He might have a flask that young mages can kill for.
> Next the snakes:
4e4de4nen
open boulder
gtell use normal
gtell use slay snake
> Then just go around and kill every snake you find:
3ne3wnen2wswenen2esdsn2esenenweswsedesesenewswnw2nedseseswswnswnen
> Then go back to see if any snakes hiding in the tiny room has moved out
enuwswu2wn2ws
> If you got any snakeskins, this is the time to hand then out to whoever
> needs them, and then wait a bit for them to finish their quests.

Note: All snakes are hidden, so most non-ktv will not be able to attack.
      Not all snakes are aggressive, so you don't want people to aura up or
      to areaspell. Thus, the killing goes a bit slower and so does the exp.
      Also, there may be many snakes in the same room, so it can hurt a bit
      if you're small.
      On the upside, once you've killed off 200 snakes (57 snakes in the area,
      so during fourth cleanup), The White Snake will come hunting you. He has
      a key for the altar at the bottom, with the fabled white snakeskin belt.


Ragnarok: (wargs)
=========
> Get to Karandras obelisk
10wn3wswswn12ws2w2sws3wnwn5u10ndswsd
> Now you have to get past some rooms which might have aggressive giants.
> Either use a peeker to make sure you don't walk into a room with several,
> or have someone sneak past them. Or pray for luck.
4wnw
> Inside the warg area.
gtell use mental
> And now just walk around the area and kill everything except Angerboda.
2wseseswenwn2wnwne2wne2ws2ws3ews2es2esws2esesws2ens2wnenwnws2wses2wns2enwnwne
> (Angerboda north of here)
2wnewnewsw2ns2wseseses2wes2w2ne
> Done!

Note: Wolves are random-delay-agg - they do not attack on entry, but there's
      a chance they will react (growl at you or something), which means they
      will attack you in a couple of seconds.
      Wolves are vuln mental but resist dark, so no do not use Nemesis.
      Angerboda is big, aggressive and summons small wolves. Skip her.


Ragnarok: (giants)
=========
> Get to Karandras obelisk
10wn3wswswn12ws2w2sws3wnwn5u10ndsesd
gtell use slay giant
> Now just go south, out in the plains and move around as you like, killing
> anything you feel you can take. If unsure of where to go, just go straight
> south until you get to the end, then go a step west or east, and then
> straight north again. Peeker is useful here, to not get too many.

Note: These guys hit VERY hard! You will want to have a tank with nice hp,
      rescues for the weak and a peeker to not get several aggies at once.
      Thor & Odin are PG-mobs, so skip them.
      Non-agg:     Viking, Valkyrie
      Agg:         Berserker, Giant Warrior
      Delayed-agg: Fire Giant, Frost Giant

Note: Many, but not all, drows walk around. Vuln pure/light/ice/slay drow-elf.
      Elite guards are agg-good, so be careful not to walk past them, leaving
      someone to battle them alone.
      Once opened, the doors will stay open until reboot.
      2 gate guards (not moving) have keys. Both are cursed. Once you learn
      where they are, you might want to turn off autoloot for those two.
      3 rooms in the west part have assassins. They are closed in by doors,
      which are better left closed, to make things less messy.
THE Dot: Ultrahidden mob. Always spawns 6sw from entry guard. Can have dots
         as eq (mana-dots and ac-dots). Have a mage locate "dot" and if any is
         found on "someone" (and the locating mage can see hidden), it means
         the dot has them.
         This dot is NOT the same as the visible (hidden) dots.
         To find it, you need to be able to see hidden, AND have sense life.
         The dot will then be in the room where you get the message:
           "You sense a hidden life form in the room."
         He is vuln unlife and flees when he's close to death.
         He is not tough or dangerous, just a bit messy to kill.
         To kill: Clean out the drows nearby
                  gtell use unlife
                  attack with some areadamage
                  tell others to "area to join"
                  Once fighting stops, he has fled. Check the rooms nearby for
                  this "You sense a hidden..." line. When found, have a mage
                  cast hell storm. This will make him flee again, so quickly
                  repeat this 5-6 times and he'll be dead.

> If all dead, recall group and move on.

Note: Women stand still, so taking this path will always get all of them.
      Women are aggressive.
      Women can murder. Not often, but it does happen.
      Women cast sun ray. Small people can easily die. If you want to play
      safe(r), have a priest cast gpow whenever you see a sun ray.
      If you don't kill all women, they might spawn badly, being two or even
      three in the same room. If this happens, the double ones are usually
      found in the south & southeast parts. There can be doubles even if you
      did kill them all.

      For extra exp, you can also take these area-harm casting mercenaries:
        83  A soldier of fortune waits here for direction
        83  An adventurer of the realm is killing some time here
      The lugrokis in the cells have cursed, heavy manacles. That's why you
      turn off autoloot. Check their corpses, in case they have some artifact.
      And don't forget to turn on autoloot again once the area is clear.

Note: Many sarakesh guys (the non-aggie ones) move around. Non-aggie ones will
      asist other non-aggies.
      Bodaks may spawn badly if not all are killed. Very often the west cell
      (nr 3 if my route is followed) has double bodaks.
      All mobs are vulnerable to mental. Most are also vuln silver. Bodaks are
      vuln slash/silver/mental/slay magical. Loads of mobs are immune dark, so
      Nemesis is a poor choice of weapon.
      Once you get comfortable, the best might be to start with top floor,
      since you'll be a bit rested and that one is most drainy. Working
      downwards it gets easier and on ground level your priests can probably
      even regain a bit of mana, which can be good for when taking the bodaks.
