NWD = Normal Weapon Damage (damdice plus damroll)

BACKSTAB, INITIAL: (Ro)
==================
Sneak up on target and place your weapon in his back, doing big damage.
Can only be done with weapons where "Damage type is Piercing".
Wait:   1 rounds
Chance: Affected by:   * Skill?
                       * Dex.
                       * Victim's dex?
                       * Level difference between stabber and victim?
                       * ?
Fail:   ---?
Succ:   
Backstab damage is NOT affected by dex nor by strength-bonuses.
Lvl 50 Ro/Ro deals [DR+15+diceroll] * 14 in backstab damage, where
  DR = Damroll, not counting the +DR bonus given by strength.
Or, to put it easier: 14 * NWD (assuming your strengh gives you +15 dr)
Backstab damage is capped by 2*(maxdamage).


BACKSTAB, IN COMBAT: (Ro)
====================
Sneak around your opponent and place your weapon in his back, doing big damage.
Can only be done with weapons where "Damage type is Piercing".
Can only be done if opponent is engaged with another character.
Wait:   2 rounds
Chance: Affected by:   * Skill?
                       * Dex?
                       * ???
Fail:   ---?
Succ:   Damage = 7 * NWD (for lvl 50 Ro/Ro).
  * Check again: Does standard strength bonus really apply?


BASH: (Fi/Te)
=====
Attempt to 'knock' a person over.
Wait:   2 rounds?
Chance: ?% chance of success
Fail:   You become resting?
        Next blow dealt to you will do more damage?
Succ:   3 damage. (always?)
        Opponent loses 1 or more attacks.
        Cumulative bashes do have an effect.
        Pure fighters gain better effects


BERSERK: (Fi)
========
Go berserk, to get extra hr/dr
Wait:   1 round if fail?
Chance: Depends on skill. ?% chance of success
Fail:   1 round waistate (?)
Succ:   Can't recall, flee, rescue, switch, quaff, recite.
        +14 damroll, +2 hr (for lvl 63 Fi/Fi)
Does not affect nr of attacks, parry, dodge, damage taken, defence (ac)


CIRCLESTAB: (Ro)
===========
Similar to backstab, but can be used both as battle initiator and in battle,
regardless of whether your opponent is engaged with you or not. Damage and
chance of success is not affected by these factors.
Wait:   2 rounds
Chance: Affected by:
          * Skill (according to help file)
          * Hitroll (according to tests). Each HR adds one percent to your
            success chance, and your chance _can_ reach 100% (0% risk of
            failing)
          * Hr bonus from strength applies normally.
          * Dex seems to apply, slightly. Half a percent per step?
          * Thac0?
          * Opponent: Major dependency, but I don't know what. Dex? Level?
            Ac, ...?
              King Elchor,  lvl 100, great ac: 100% chance of success
              GoA Cherubim, lvl  35, poor ac:   65% chance of success
              So what does apply? I don't know, but something!
              Guess: Dex and only dex.
Fail:   ---?
Succ:   Damage = 2 * NWD (for lvl 50 Ro/Ro). Normal str-bonus applies.
        IRV:s are ignored.

HEADBANG: (Fi/Wl)
=========
Damage your opponent by headbanging him.
Wait:   1 rounds
Chance: ?% chance of success
Fail:   ---?
Succ:   <level>/2 damage?


KICK: (Fi/Nb)
=====
Damage your opponent by kicking him.
Wait:   2 rounds
Chance: Depends on skill. ?% chance of success
Fail:   ---?
Succ:   <level> damage


PARRY: (Fi/??)  DODGE: (Ro/Wl/Nb)
======          ======
Avoid an attack from your enemy. For parry you must wield a weapon.
Wait:   ---
Chance: Special. See below.
Fail:   ---
Succ:   No damage received

Chance to dodge/parry does not depend on the level of the opponent.
Chance to dodge/parry strike 1: skill %
Chance to dodge/parry strike 2: skill/2 %
Chance to dodge/parry strike 3: skill/3 %
Chance to dodge/parry strike 4: skill/4 %
Chance to dodge/parry strike 5: skill/5 %
Bonuses from items are added after chance has been calculated (see tests below)
When attacked by more than one mob, dodge/parry is calculated separately for
each mob.
It is possible, but unverified, that the chance to dodge/parry can never go
below 5%, no matter how many attacks your opponent has (provided you have the
skill)


PUMMEL: (Fi)
=======
Push your opponent to make him lose his balance.
Wait:   2 rounds
Chance: ?
Fail:   ---?
Succ:   Next strike will always hit and do extra damage


QUICKDRAW: (Ro-55?)
==========
Switch weapon without losing any time.
Wait:   Instant if successful?
Chance: Depends on skill. <skill>% chance of success?
Fail:   2 round waistate (?), previously wielded & target weapon both in inv.
Succ:   Weapon switched instantly(?)

Can be trained up to 35%, but can be brought up to 100% with practice.
Can only be improved if you practice it while fighting?
Time to switch weapon the conventional way, depending on if you are fighting
or not, and whether you keep your weapons in a bag or not:
  Notfighting (bag): 0-1s
  Fighting    (bag): 8-9s 
  Notfighting (inv): 0-1s
  Fighting    (inv):   5s 
So quickdraw is only of interest if you need to switch weapon during a fight.
Keeping your weapons in your inventory will let you wield the new weapon one
round faster, and saves one additional round in the end, for spells/skills.
Quickdraw also lets you wield the weapon one round faster, and also save you
an additional round in the end (if quickdraw is instant and without delay).
But, only of interest when you have to switch weapon mid-fight.


SLASHING/PIERCING/BLUDGEONING: (all)
==============================
Makes you skilled in that type weapons, adding damage to your attacks.
In reality, though, they do not affect anything, or the bonus is neglegctible.
                            Skill 0:                 Skill 50:
Hit/total percentage:   504/888 = 56.76 %        503/871 = 57.75 %
Special hits (>Mass):     0/504 =  0.00 %          6/503 =  1.19 %
Avg damage per hit  : 11173/504 = 22.17 hp     11274/503 = 22.41 hp

Conclusion: These skills might affect your chance of getting special hits,
but even if they do, the bonus you get from the skill is so small it's hardly
noticable.
