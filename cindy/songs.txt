Q 01:
=====
5p (a mob)
I'm a simple man, never looked for fame.
My profession is common but what is my name?
Wielding my weapon I walk here a lot.
The things I kill never move from the spot.

3p (last chance)
I am six foot tall and dressed in a shirt
wearing boots that are covered with dirt.
I sleep all night and I work all day,
'cause I'm a lumberjack and I'm ok.


Q 02:
=====
5p (a mob)
Red is my aura, black is my soul.
Formed from a mist, with a solid goal:
I want to sacrifice you to the shades,
using my dagger with spider shaped blades.

3p
I'm having a really awful breath.
Standing too close might cause your death.
Better leave now or you will go down
for I'm the toughest girl in this town.

2p (last chance)
Still not a clue? Perhaps you don't know?
Well here's a hint: I live down in Drow.
Still not a soul that can tell it? Oh my!
Ok, here's the last hint: Starts with a 'Y'


Q 03:
=====
5p (a mob)
Some people spit and call me rat.
But some have been regretting that.
Four foot tall with sword in hand
and boots on feet, don't I look grand? (...not!)

3p (last chance)
Oh well, I guess I stink and smell.
It's all because of where I dwell.
And yes, I _am_ a rat, I guess,
transformed a bit, though. What a bless! (...not!)


Q 04:
=====
5p (an item)
When I was young and of lesser height
I needed something to increase my might.
Listening to stories from tougher men
made me go search 'till I found a den.

3p (last chance)
I slew the beast and took his hide.
It smelled real bad and was much too wide,
weighed a ton, made me look all wrong
but I didn't care 'cause it made me strong.


Q 05:
=====
5p (an item)
Looking for power I went to this guy,
I said I'm real nice and he fell for my lie.
I told him I wanted strength like a tree
and speed like a fly. He just looked straight at me.
...
Then he spoke and he told me of magical things,
weapons of fire and powerful rings.
-What I wear does change speed and strength quite a lot, but...
-That's great!, I replied and attacked on the spot.

3p
He died within seconds - he wasn't so tough.
Perhaps what he told me had all been a bluff?
Wondering what his strange item could be
I looked at it... Weird! It looked back at me.

2p
It had to be special so I put it on,
then I couldn't remove it - something was wrong.
I guess I'll be wearing this thing 'till I die.
Now I'm fast as a tree and strong as a fly :o(
(ok... item is actually just nodrop and NOT noremove - Artistic freedom ;-)

1p (last chance)
Can anyone help me, I've not even reached 20,
and killed one priest, and mimics plenty.
For some reason I feel like a... lemon-placed fairy-man?
But that's just for wearing this .....-..... ........


Q 06:
=====
5p (a mob)
Working in this bakery
not a bread is sold by me.
I have only fruits for sale
and, by the way, I am a male.

3p (last chance)
A kiwi? An apple? A grape or two?
Oranges? Pears? What misses you?
My wares are good for gods, you know.
That's why I'm here and not below.


Q 07:
=====
5p (a mob)
Three foot tall with a long, brown beard.

playing hide and seek - cheating to win.
Always having fun, never feeling down,
this Forest Brownie, living west of town.


Q 08:
=====
5p (an item)
Here I lie, just gathering dust
in a heap of carnage, glad I can't rust.
I'm very smooth and black as night.
Come and get me. I don't bite.

3p (last chance)
On your finger I will fit,
increasing damage when you hit.
The monsters here might want you dead.
Seek and you'll find me in their bed.

Q 09:
=====
5p (a mob)
I was standing on a cloud
close to God and very proud.
Dressed in silver, white and blue
and smiling friendly towards you.

3p
Immortal staff, though, kicked me down
and bound me to this central town.
Perhaps someday I'll find a chain
to climb back up, above the rain.

2p (last chance)
Helping everyone in need
I want to do another deed
Could you a message for me get:
Has the eagle landed yet?
(note: He's found his chain and climbed back up again)


Q 10:
=====
5p (a mob)
Bred to cause fear on the battle field.
Trained to be fierce and never to yield.
I show no mercy, never pass you by.
Hear me. See me. Then you die.

3p (last chance)
To make things worse I'm not alone.
We're a pack of five when we leave home.
And usually five when we come back again.
A War God's pets are seldom slain by men.


Q 11:
=====
5p (a mob)
Lots of brain, very small
Has no guts, has no ball.
Staring uncaring, lacking soul
but I passed quality control.

3p (last chance)
Floating aimlessly around
In this place where I am bound
Waiting for the rest of me
When it comes, a guard I'll be.


Q 12:
=====
5p (a mob)
Mirror, mirror on the wall
who's the strongest of them all?
Hera put me on a test
so I showed her I'm the best.

3p (last chance)
The prize I got was endless life
(She wouldn't agree to be my wife)
Now every night I pass you by
blinking handsomely in the sky.


Q 13:
=====
5p (a mob)
I'm the strongest! I'm the best!
I'm superior! F... the rest!
At least up here, the place people seek.
They all wann'a get here, even the meek.

3p
I'm number one! There is but me!
Attacking everyone I see.
The second mobs are everywhere
they'll kill you too and I won't care.

2p (last chance)
The third and fourth ones are here too,
but back to me, the number uno.
I'm one, un, adjin, ett, yksi and ein.
Followed by secundus, tertion and others non-prime.


Q 14:
=====
5p (a real pain in the... )
I'm a mage and a priest, highbie and strong.
The monsters I find will never live long.
I slash and I crush and I spell them to death.
Within a few moments they take their last breath.
...
But straight from the day that I came to this place
I've been bugged by a monster who leaves me no space.
He's always around, always giving me pain.
I've kicked at him, run from him - always in vain.

3p
The monster I speak of is slower than slow,
yet always behind me wherever I go.
He never has hit me with weapon nor spell
but playing me tricks that has given me hell.

2p (last chance)
I pay him attention, my feet feels like led.
Cursing and swearing and wishing him dead.
He caught me again, he is always a nag.
And always nearby me. His name? It is ...


Q 15:
=====
5p (a mob)
Ragged and old, exiled and cold.
Sick to the bone, all alone.
Lying groaning on his cot
with a "nothing" - worth a lot!

3p
Dreary cavern, ugly boot
humming necklace, not for loot.
Shirt so cool (you'd love it too),
saying: DEATH IS COMING FOR YOU!

2p (last chance)
He's the bum of this beach

This is Venden. He is here.
By now the answer should be clear.

cursed, cursed, cursed!
Take it away.
Damned, damned, damned!
'tis not my day.

3p
I was a mighty, humble servant
to the gods above
Why can't they let me die in peace?
Show a little love?

2p (last chance)
Buried in this building of triangularic shape.
Wrapped up like a present with a little too much tape.

Hey! People! Come down here and die!
All in all it's just a
another way to get by.

3p
I don't need no friggin' daylight. I've had lots of time to think.
I am fine. I have good eyesight. I just want some blood to drink.
Hey! People! Let me have a bite!
All in all you're just a
another prey in the night.

2p (last chance)
Accused of crimes far worse than rape. Sword so black and yet it's bright.

another Vampire Lord.

Yesterday, all his specials seemed so fun and gay.
Now he's fighting us and it's no play.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.
...
Suddenly, he is not the man he used to be.
We are all fooled by his trickery.
Oh, why are you all hurting me?

4p
Why he ran away, wouldn't say, nobody know.
Now it's hide and seek, find the sneak!
Where did he go oh oh oh...

3p
Yesterday, all I wanted was his gloves. I'd pray
every night that there would come a day
when I would get his gloves, some way.
...
Suddenly! He was killed by us and I could see
that his gauntlets were our property
and I rolled good - they went to me.

Will you run off before it's too late?

4p
Does the blood on your backside feel warm to your skin?
Do you realize the danger you've put yourself in?
Do you like to feel pain? What did you hope do gain?
Give up now! This has all been in vain.

3p
Still around? Stupid knight! You are not very bright.
Don't you get it? You won't get my key!

Q 26:
=====
5p (a mob) Original author: Gloria Gaynor, Title "I will survive")
First I was afraid, I was horrified.
Kept thinking I would not survive, that this was suicide.
But then I spent so many nights
in that place - I have no frights
for those sights.
So bring'em on in heavy stride!

4p
And so I'm back! I won't play nice.
I will cut out your eerie eyes
I will not be the one who dies!
So come on you scaly beast
this will surely be a feast.
Having eight legs and a tail
will not help you in the least!

3p
It's shuffling around. It's a reptilian.
It's large. It's dangerous! Be sure that it can kill a man.
It's gaze can stone you, don't know why
so meet its gaze and it's byebye!
You think I'd crumble?
You think I'd lay down and die?

2p
Oh no, not I!
I will survive.
My conti' saves me every time
so I know I will be fine.
I use blood mirror when alone
in case its gaze turns me to stone
and when it dies...
I get more frags - I love this zone!

1p (last chance)
I will survive!
and I will thrive.
The Well is great - just take a dive

it's fun to kill a bas.....


Q 27:
=====
5p (a mob) Original author: Paul Simon, Title "The Boxer")
I am just a poor boy, on a storage box - not old.
I am putting up resistance,
to discourage all intruders of these premises.
Go! Let me rest! All the men here
are real men to fear and tutoring the rest.
Sha la la la la la la la
la la la la laa

4p
Well, I have no home nor family. I am no more than a boy
in the company of teachers
in the quiet of the entrance to this underground.
Down below: Many students in dark quarters applicating what they know
and some masters that might kill you if you're slow.

3p
If you're looking for a challenge you will surely find it here
but don't go to Bob's home.
He will summon all his friends - you'll be a bloody heap.
Why do you stare? Is it my cut-up face? It's not handsome.
My scars will never heal.
Sha la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la la la la la la laa

2p (last chance)
On this crate I sit. I'm 12 years old. Scars covering my face.

in your anger and your pain:
"I am leaving! I am leaving!".
But my scars will still remain.

Bravely bold Sir <name>
is equipped with lots of stuff
He thinks he's dressed in a mithril suit
Oh, brave Sir <name>
He's eyeing you suspiciously
just because you're armed
And because he is a guardian
of this town. You have been warned!

3p
He's protecting the innocent
and he looks like he can fight.
But his eq isn't worth two cent.
He's Brave but not too bright.
His stuff is all of iron.
His head must be of wood.
If he'd checked before he tried them on
he should have understood:

2p (last chance)
He's got iron sleeves
and an iron helm
and an iron breast plate
and an iron girth
and iron leggings
and iron boots
and iron gauntlets

Q 30:
=====
This song is written by someone who wants to bring to your attention that visitors of lesser levels may experience some degree of uncomfortability upon meeting him,
and that this was an intentional inconvenience in order to decrease the frequency of reduced solitude brought upon him by less experienced explorers.
The title of the song is: BEAT IT OR DIE, NOOB!
Ehrmm... Well, here goes:

5p (a mob) Original author: Ted Garestad, Title "I want a moon of my own")
I bet you never saw it coming.
I bet you thought this place was great.
Just easy exp. Not too much running.
But I'll reduce your rate.

4p
You killed those rats. You killed those children.
Without a thought. No guilt or remorse.
So why surprised that you got killed, then?
The blame is none but yours.

3p
This is me! I'm making money!
I pay no workers' fee.
These slaves are mine and mine alone to kill.
You're such a noob it's almost funny.
Not even try to flee?
You'll die to me again. I bet you will!

2p
Just one wrong step, the last you will do.
I never move, so don't take that turn.
Avoid my workshop or I'll kill you.
Is that so hard to learn?

1p (last chance)
I'm standing still in Kender Village
And where I live is easy to see.
And yet you come to kill and pillage
And stumble into me.
...
People call me newbie slayer
I call it learn by pain!
This is just another way to teach.
Against me you had no prayer
your fight was all in vain.
Go bother someone else you little leech.

3p (a player or room name, last chance) Original author: Bill Sutton, Title "Do It Yourself")
I went to buy equipment, was charged 2 billion bucks
for a potion or an onion, now that price really sucks!
So I left his shop to see whatever other shops I'd find
hoping for a player shop that wouldn't rob me blind!
...
Chorus (does NOT have any hints):
Cromwell, Gnoth and Zephyr have scarcely anything

Let's burn all shops to cinders and blow their stash away

Q 31b:
======
3p (a player or room name, last chance)
The next shopkeeper said he'd been created as a toy.
He'd come here from the future to terminate a boy.
His body was of metal, his voice modulator poor
so I told him "Oil B bak!" and headed for the door.
...

Q 31c:
======
3p (a player or room name, last chance)

Well, finally I found a place with stuff I could afford.
It mostly carried trash that nobody would hoard.
The listing was a mess and the stock was wiped each boot
but at least it came with prices matching your own loot.
...
Chorus (does NOT have any hints):

Tell me more, tell me more, like, did he have his robe?

4p
He attacked me, he was magic born - what a battle, got his robe torn
He craved my life, mad as a hound - showing off, casting spells all around

Tell me more, tell me more, 'cause he sounds like an elf

2p
All the torture got to his brain - all these lindskiarns made him insane

Such a treat, to late to be sweet, but uh-oh that fellow could fight
...
Tell me more, tell me more, was he crazed or unwell?
Tell me more, tell me more, could he teach me a spell?

1p (last chance)
Though remorsing, I put him to rest - turned his corpse in, solved me a quest

I earn when someone's out of luck

4p
Here I am in this well known place
I'm talkin' sharp 'n' you've heard my phrase
Got a secretary here to help with my work
Let her rob you blind 'n' then I'm off with a smirk.

3p
Women out in action
losing balance for a fraction.
I'm a tad to late for a living date.
You are in my arms but I get no reaction.
So do your standard whining
And then you'll call on the king
You had your balls in a vice - you got beaten bad
but to me that's income, so I ain't sad
...
Oh God I am the Burning putz.
But now I'm covered in your guts.
I'm not a miserable sonofabitch
Your incompetence is making me rich.
...
(I wander wander

So I've gone out 'n' got me another haul.
Returned 'n' delivered. Answered your call.
I'm back and ready, just come and ask
when none of those "heroes" are up for the task.
Oh God, oh God, I'm so fantastic!
I love mass deaths - makes me spastic
And my name was never Bobby
Wait right here, I'll get your body,
And my name was never Bobby
Wait right here, I'll get your body,
And my name was never Bobby... (etc.)


Q 34:
=====
5p (a mob) Original author: Nena, Title "99 Red balloons")
Note: Written BEFORE 061210
99 deaths today
Why am I such common prey?
People come here now and then
Find me, kill me
leave again
Once this was a scary zone
feared by players. Demons' home
Nowadays the traffic's high
As 99 players a day run by

4p
99 times you have killed me
99 times - getting silly
Summon, summon, super-scurry
Call my pawns out in a hurry
Then I use another power
Stinking cloud! My minions cower
I curse in silence as I see
my 99 minions charge at me

3p
99 blows aimed at me
I'm a gonner, as you see.
Take a stroll around the town
while my own demons bring me down
When I'm dead, loot the corpse
Get the scroll, now it's yours
Ditch the other stuff you've found
as 99 aggressives walk around

2p (last chance)
99 scrolls in your bag
One for every death I've had
It's all over and you're standin' pretty
In this dust that was a city
You have my "llik" as souvenir
Proof of the crime committed here
And here I am with another scroll
I wish that I could let it go


Q 35:
=====
5p (a mob) Original author: The Drifters, Title "Save the last dance for me")
You can fight
every fight with each guy who's givin' you the eye
Let them feel your might
Give'm pain
Any monster of man, to die by your hand
'neath the pale moonlight
But don't forget my mission, go see
that mob you vowed would cease to be
So darlin' slay that one mob for me

4p
Well you can know
that a genocide's such a lovely ride
Go and have your fun
Slice and dice
but when they're torn apart, go stab the heart
of that chosen one
So don't forget you've got until boot
before this contract's void and moot
So darlin' slay that mob, keep the loot

3p
Baby don't you know you can't go wrong
this is just a simple test
I'll reward you when he's dead and gone
so solve my daily quest

2p (last chance)
When he's dead
You can carry on till the night is gone
And it's time to go
If you try
If you come and ask for another task
I will tell you no
Cause don't forget it's one quest a day
And every time a random prey
So darlin', since you're done, go away.


Q 36:
=====
5p (an area) Original author: Bruce Springsteen, Title "I'm on Fire"
Hey little girl where's your daddy gone?
Did you run away, leave him all alone?
Let me bring you in
Oh, oh, oh, a ruby ring

4p
Tell me now guards will you let me through
I see the gates are locked and the key's on you
Or shall I sneak around?
Oh, oh, oh, through the garden ground

3p
Inside I see courtiers and men in fancy clothes
There's a lady and a lord and some maids ofcourse
But I leave again
Oh, oh, oh, for the jailor's den.

2p (last chance)
Some dark mage is here locked up in a cell
He's got this key leading straight to hell
I can't beat this guy
Oh, oh, oh, time to die.


Q 37:
=====
6p (a mob) Original author: Don McLean?, Title "American pie")
A long long time ago
I can still remember
How that slayer made me wet my pants
And I knew if we tried once more
we'd just provide death spam galore
We knew we didn't really have a chance

5p
But the 50-limit went astray
We grew in power every day
Bad news for the Ancient
His days of glory all spent
I can't remember if I cried
when I heard about his fallen pride
I missed that awesome PG ride
the day the great God died

4p
So bye, bye, mr mythical pain.
Our levelling and training has not been in vain
Your items are now carried by mortals - your bane
Singing finally that God has been slain
Finally that God has been slain

3p
Do you have any of his set
And can you use that eq yet
Those are really highbie stuff
Evil chars can't wear his crown
His slayer surely wears you down
With 25 your strength still ain't enough

2p
Well I know his bones give dodge increase
And his mantle is an awesome piece
His weapon ain't no knife
And his crown gives perm sense life
I was a lowbie then, a common sight.
His loot was way beyond my might
But I still curse I missed that fight
the day the great God died

1p (last chance)
But _now_ we're singing: (ok, this might be a bit of an exaggeration)
Cake, cake! That God's just a fake.
His eq is still good, and it's easy to take
No withering needed, he's simple to break
That Demoncity God is a fake!
That Demoncity God is a fake.
