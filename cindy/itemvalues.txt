Don't know what to pick in a pg?
Not sure if your offered trade is decent or a ripoff?
This file won't give you a prefect answer, but it might be used to get a feel
for what different items are worth, or to fing out if a certain item is higher
valued than another.

The first is a listing of all items I've seen sold on auction for over 50M.
Only the highest bid for each item is shown. Note that the value of items can
change over time, so it it may be bad to use as a guideline.
The lists further down show the order in which items were picked in actual
PG:s. Only top 50 picks listed for each PG.
Some common sense might be needed to interpret the data.
