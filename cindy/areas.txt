Size:         79
Monsters:     7
Dangers:      1 DT
Speedie:      Solace: 7seu2nw4n3e3n3u6en
Abandoned? Yeah, right! These caves have become a nest for a group of foul
orcs who have sealed off a large part of the cave inhabited by even worse
beings. If you're tough enough to stand your ground against Deep Ones and
Hunting Horrors, seek out Shub-Niggurath in the darkest, deepest place, and
maybe he'll let you have a look at his pnakotic manuscripts before ending your
life.

GALAXY
Creator:      Doctor
Suggestion:   10-30
Restrictions: -
Mob levels:   4-36
Size:         60

Dangers:      2 DT:s
Speedie:      Karandras: 10wn3wswswn3w4ne4ne3n2e2nw3ne2ne4ne8nend
Astronomers' heaven! You're so close to the stars you can even touch them. All
sorts from white dwarves to red supergiants are here, as are all the Zodiac
signs and some well known star constellations. Find out where Hercules gets
his strength or have a closer look at Orion's belt. But beware of places too
dark or too bright.

NIRVANA
Creator:      Forstall/Alander
Suggestion:   25-75
Restrictions: -
Mob levels:   18-70
Size:         63
Monsters:     12
Dangers:      0 DT:s
Speedie:      Olympus: e3n2un, enter hole, s2u
This is the place you've strived to get to? Well, don't expect your visit here
to be a peaceful and harmonic one. Obviously you don't deserve to be here, or
these guys wouldn't be so touchy about your presence. Funny names... decaton,
nonaton, octon, septon,... Can you find "Nr One" in this place?

NEFERTUM'S WHITE SNAKE LAIR
Creator:      Nefertum
Suggestion:   50-100
Restrictions: -
Mob levels:   ?-?
Size:         72
Monsters:     ?
Dangers:      1 DT
Speedie:      Slithering: e
This is a lair of... guess what? Snakes! Lots'a snakes! And then some more
snakes. Kill enough of them and guess who'll appear to avenge them:
A... snake!

THE RUINED CITY OF ALCHOR
Creator:      Arcane/Fanth
Suggestion:   40-80
Restrictions: -
Mob levels:   36-76
Size:         74
Monsters:     7
Dangers:      1 DT
Speedie:      Elven Village: 2sw2s2es2eses2en
Once a nice little city. Now overrun by creatures called "Lindskiarns". A race
known for their ability to stand in fire without breaking a sweat, but as all
beings they do have their weaknesses. This band is fairly organized under a
warchief who is known to torture his prisoners.

AMAZONIA
Creator:      Leaf
Suggestion:   10-30
Restrictions: -
Mob levels:   5-30
Size:         65
Monsters:     15
Dangers:      2 DT:s
Speedie:      New Thalos: 2en2e2nes2en2eses4e
Often confused with the village Krashkarand just west of this area, but this
place has a small village of its own, a waterfall and a mountain. Apart from
villagers you will mostly find wildlife here, but if you're searching really
hard you might also find a miner. He's not interested in being found, though.

RANDOM'S AMBER KEEP
Creator:      Random
Suggestion:   50-100
Restrictions: -
Mob levels:   8-55 (97+)
Size:         74
Monsters:     31
Dangers:      1 DT
Speedie:      Karandras: 10es
A keep of ogres. You will also find gnolls, ants, horses, dogs and even a few
innocent travellers. If you can find the keys needed, a visit to the prison
cells might prove interesting. And for some reason, probably the privacy
provided by these unfriendly ogres, the master magician Gandolf has placed the
portal to his office on the top floor.

THE AMPHITHEATRE
Creator:      Gobzilla
Suggestion:   51-100
Restrictions: -
Mob levels:   90-97+
Size:         79
Speedie:      Sundhaven: 6es2es3ese2n4w
Monsters:     6
Dangers:      0 DT:s, aggressive warrior priests walking around in the area.
The headquarter for a cult of grolims - worshippers of some evil god. The
place is crowded with quite unfriendly priests but if you manage to get past
them, somewhere deep inside you may find a dragon, a demon lord and perhaps
even the one they call "The child of dark".

ANCALADOR/NECROMANCER'S GUILD
Creator:      CAW
Suggestion:   10-25
Restrictions: -
Mob levels:   6-23
Size:         57
Monsters:     19
Dangers:      1 DT (accessible from 3 rooms)
Speedie:      Karandras: 10wn3wswswn10w2swse2sws
It's easy to miss the fact that this cave is actually the remnants of the
great dragon Ancalador. Long since dead, his corpse is now a home for a group
of necromancers and their minions. Enter his month, travel through his
intestines and exit through his... back door. Enjoy the amazing view of
stalagmites when crossing the bridge to reach his guarded centre, but don't
fall down!

THE ANCIENT LANDS
Creator:      Arcane/Fanth
Suggestion:   45-100
Restrictions: -
Mob levels:   45?-95+
Size:         99
Monsters:     ?
Dangers:      1 DT, The whole northern part is norecall, the northwest maze
              has only one exit, past a lvl 85:ish guardian. Rex moves around
              in the north part and will kill you if he sees you.
Speedie:      Kings castle: 3wnwne2nw2n2wn5ws2wne2ne2nen3en2es2ene2nwn
Enter this large volcano and discover a world from eons ago. Watch the ancient
rituals of neanderthals or see the majestic allosaurus flee from a group of
hungry velociraptors. Just be sure not to disturb the king of dinosaurs, the
Tyrannosaurus Rex!

ANTHARIA
Creator:      Unknown
Suggestion:   10-100
Restrictions: -
Mob levels:   9-42
Size:         51
Monsters:     20
Dangers:      0 DT:s
Speedie:      Sundhaven: 2e4n2w2ndne2sesesed
This small underwater city is very peaceful indeed, with guards and knights
patrolling the place. The people are trying to get along with everyone, so
every intelligent race has a couple of representatives here, making sure the
peace is kept. An occational adventurer may come by now and then, wreaking
havoc and slaughtering the defenseless antharians, but that's a rare event.
Pay them a visit some time - they deserve to be punished!

ANTIRIAD
Creator:      Torain
Suggestion:   50-80
Restrictions: -
Mob levels:   45-80
Size:         77
Monsters:     10
Dangers:      1 DT:s
Speedie:      Elven Village: 2sw2s2es2e
This little town must have been wonderful in the past. Paved streets,
impressing buildings, statues,... Now it's all in ruins with no clues on what
happened to the former inhabitants. Rubble and dust covers the place, now home
to some snotty nosed gangly creatures called Skorns. Others have moved in too
and few of them tolerate visitors. The cave north of the ruins is home to the
evil Lord Sith. Did he cause this tragedy? Or did he just move here to enjoy
the solitude? We will probably never know for sure what happened here.

ARACHNOS
Creator:      DikuMUD
Suggestion:   5-50
Restrictions: -
Mob levels:   5-49
Size:         58
Monsters:     19
Dangers:      2 DT:s, the place is much like a maze
Speedie:      Karandras: 10wn3wswswn12ws3wu
A huge spiders nest, home for giant spiders and some other beasts. Be careful
not to get lost in the maze or trapped in the web. If you can find your way
past the dead ends, deadly traps and dangerous foes you might get an audience
with Empress Spider Arachnos herself. She gives a hearty welcome to all new
slaves.

THE BURNING ARENA
Creator:      Burning staff
Suggestion:   1-100
Restrictions: -
Mob levels:   -
Size:         52
Monsters:     0
Dangers:      0 DT:s, Risk for public humiliation
Speedie:      Karandras: 3nws
Want to test your powers? Get revenge? See if you're smart enough to defeat an
opponent who might actually use a strategy against you? Or maybe take your
verbal argument to another, more physical, level? The arena is here for your
pleasure... and pain! And thanks to the nifty arena-channel you can be sure
that everyone else will hear about your great victory or embarrassing defeat.

THE UPPER ARGO
Creator:      Unknown
Suggestion:   30-65
Restrictions: -
Mob levels:   30-64
Size:         52
Monsters:     16
Dangers:      0 DT:s
Speedie:      Ultima: 3nd5nund3n
Mostly known and appreciated for its large troll population, this place also
has a fair amount of dragons and dragoneers, the open fields making the place
perfect for takeoffs, landings and mock fights between them. The dragons are
well trained to ignore distractions, but they will defend themselves if
attacked. Have a go at them if you dare - they will appreciate the practice.
But you'd probably do better by hunting down trolls like all the other
visitors.

ASTRAL PLANE/GITHYANKI
Creator:      Andi/Klaaw
Suggestion:   50-100
Restrictions: -
Mob levels:   65-97+
Size:         78+
Monsters:     10+
Dangers:      0 DT:s, first part is a maze
Speedie:      Olympus: e3n2unu, enter portal
Once a rarely visited lowbie area, this place was given a powerboost and is
now one of the more dangerous places to visit. The welcoming maze of astral
rooms is still there if you manage to get past the guardian, but the maze
inhabitants are now a lot more inclined to find you greet you with a friendly
smack in the spleen or a playful smash on the skull. And if you manage to get
past the maze, you'll find the githyankis deadlier than ever. Bring friends.
Bring LOTS of friends.

ATLANTIS
Creator:      Torain
Suggestion:   5-50
Restrictions: -
Mob levels:   3-25 (40, 80)
Size:         100
Monsters:     30
Dangers:      0 DT:s
Speedie:      Atlantis: -
Explore the sea in all its beauty. See the marvels of the ocean up close.
Anemones, sea horses, lobsters, clams, sharks and all the other wildlife of
the ocean. Atlantis is but a whisper of its former glory but the city still
remains, deep under the surface. And if you go deeper you might even get a
glimpse of Neptunus, God of the Sea.

FANG'S BLACK CASTLE
Creator:      Fang
Suggestion:   50-100
Restrictions: -
Mob levels:   30-85
Size:         82
Monsters:     19
Dangers:      0 DT:s
Speedie:      King's Castle: 3wnwne2nw2nwne3sesen
As the name suggests, this is not a friendly place. Expect hordes of undeads
and other evil-doers. Getting past the walls and into the centre is a hard
task but the reward is... even harder and deeper evil. The castle is past
salvation and the evil is rooted to the core. Enter if you dare. Pray if you
care. But most of all, Beware!

BURNING TOWERS
Creator:      Bane
Suggestion:   1-100
Restrictions: -
Mob levels:   -
Size:         60
Monsters:     0
Dangers:      0 DT:s, Risk for public humiliation
Speedie:      Karandras: 3nws3dnu
Burning Arena + Quake = Burning Towers. This place has portals, lava rooms
powerups and other features inspired from Quake DeathMatch. A good place to
vent frustration or perhaps just slaughter your friends for fun.

NEW ELEMENTAL CANYON
Creator:      Raff
Suggestion:   15-60
Restrictions: -
Mob levels:   2-60
Size:         55
Monsters:     35
Dangers:      0 DT:s
Speedie:      Elemental Canyon: -
Elementals galore! This little canyon is home to elementals of all sizes.
Bustling with activity, the inhabitants have learned to accept each other and
move about freely. Earth, fire, water, air and lightning - each element has
its own designated part and ruler, with a mix of everything in the middle,
the floor of the canyon.

DWARVEN CATACOMBS
Creator:      Raff
Suggestion:   10-25
Restrictions: -
Mob levels:   5-24
Size:         69
Monsters:     17
Dangers:      0 DT:s
Speedie:      Karandras: 10ed3n
Located in the ground below the dwarven kingdom is a large complex where the
dwarves place their dead comrades. This unattended maze has been desecrated by
graverobbers and necromancers, resulting in undeads and spirits haunting the
place. A group of templars have taken residence in the north part but are
making no attempt to clear the catacombs of evildoers nor put the undeads to
rest. They even attack pure hearted adventurers on sight! Perhaps their
purpose is only to guard the legendary sword rumored to be hidden there?

THE ABANDONED CATHEDRAL
Creator:      CAW
Suggestion:   10-30
Restrictions: -
Mob levels:   6-27
Size:         55
Monsters:     14
Dangers:      1 DT
Speedie:      New Thalos: 2en2e2n2w2n
This holy place for worship, contemplation and rest was attacked by an evil
priestess who slaughtered the believers and turned the cathedral into an
unholy place used for blood sacrifice and worshipping of evil gods. Unable to
find peace the poor victims still haunt the place, waiting for a hero to come
and put things right.

THE VARAK-KI CAVERNS
Creator:      Arcane/Fanth
Suggestion:   40-75
Restrictions: level >= 20
Mob levels:   15-79? (91)
Size:         90
Monsters:     17
Dangers:      0 DT:s, don't upset the black dragon and stay away from the
              tribe chief
Speedie:      Karandras: 10e8n2wnen
A large cavern, but apparently not large enough. The first part holds a tribe
of Varak-Ki. The northern, innermost part is home for a tribe of gnomes. And
in between, a large battlefield where they fight each other for more space.
Deeper down, close to the battlefield lives a great dragon who wishes to be
left alone.

DARKENWOOD MOUNTAIN
Creator:      Jydara
Suggestion:   15-45
Restrictions: -

Size:         62
Monsters:     13
Dangers:      0 DT:s
Speedie:      Solace: 9sws
A rather large cave in a dark forest, crawling with spiders, snakes, bugs and
goblins. The guards will let you pass but won't tolerate any violence. The
ruler of this cave is King Grognok. He's got a little treasure that's up for
grabs if you can find it. He's also got a skeleton in his closet.

THE DUNGEONS OF LORD CEANYTH
Creator:      Tjaden/Amaranth
Suggestion:   50-85
Restrictions: -
Mob levels:   60-80
Size:         98
Monsters:     10
Dangers:      0 DT:s, aggressive monsters walking around in the area.
Speedie:      King's Castle: 6wnw11nwsd
Almost as large as the citadel itself, this prison complex below is the final
destination for numerous prisoners, both human and orc. The cells themselves
aren't locked but a large number of guards, beasts and monsters keep the
inmates from taking off. NO visiting hours. The guards may let you pass but
don't expect their pets to be so lenient.

THE CHESSBOARD OF KARANDRAS
Creator:      CircleMUD
Suggestion:   20-50
Restrictions: -
Mob levels:   6-55?
Size:         67
Monsters:     12
Dangers:      0 DT:s, aggressive monsters walking around in the area.
Speedie:      Sundhaven: 2w5nwn2unw
Care for a game of chess? In this 8 x 8 tiled area the chess pieces battle
each other for real. See the poor pawns getting sacrificed to the bigger
pieces. Chose your side and have a go at the bishop, the rook and the knight.
Or perhaps go for the rulers themselves - the queen and the king.

CIQUALA'S LAIR
Creator:      Unknown
Suggestion:   10-50
Restrictions: -
Mob levels:   21?-52
Size:         20
Monsters:     17
Dangers:      0 DT:s, aggressive mobs
Speedie:      Solace: 9sesd
The hideout for the infamous lich Ciquala and his undead minions and
automatons. This place stinks of evil and should be wiped out before the lich
is able to create enough underlings to start an attack on the helpless people
above ground.

THE CIRCUS
Creator:      Binky
Suggestion:   1-10
Restrictions: -
Mob levels:   1-10
Size:         50
Monsters:     30
Dangers:      0 DT:s
Speedie:      Entrance to Circus is "A large travelling fair" that moves
              around between 5 locations. When moving it can't be entered.
              1: Karandras: 7w
              2: Kerofk: s4w
              3: Sundhaven: 7s
              4: Ofcol: 4sw
              5: Solace: 7s
The whole circus is located inside this travelling fair moving from city to
city. Outside the main tent are some entertainers and a candy store. To get
inside you will need a ticket, but if you're interested in watching knife
throwers, lions, clowns and line dancers, it is money well spent. There are
plenty of other animals and they even claim to have a unicorn, though this
might just be a way to get more visitors.

THE CITADEL
Creator:      Unknown
Suggestion:   50-100
Restrictions: -
Mob levels:   20-80?
Size:         128

Dangers:      0 DT:s, aggressive guards walking around in the courtyard.
Speedie:      King's Castle: 6wnwn
An elven citadel ruled by Lord Ceanyth and Lady Nydethiel. Visitors are not
welcome but the guards in the courtyard are slow and sleepy, so if you are
quick you can get past them. Once inside the citadel, feel free to look
around. Beware the Lord, though. He's doesn't like evil people.

THE CITADEL OF THE ORDER
Creator:      Arcane/Fanth
Suggestion:   45-100
Restrictions: -
Mob levels:   30-95? (5, 10)

Monsters:     19
Dangers:      1 DT
Speedie:      Sundhaven: 6es2es3ese3n2e4s3es3wn
Paladins galore! Hordes and hordes of them. All dressed in black and all evil.
The initiates may be a little grumpy at your presence, but disregarding those,
you are free to visit and have a look around as long as you stay clear of the
templar floor - the grand master doesn't want to be disturbed.

Speedie:      Solace: 7s
A peaceful little valley south of Solace with a lake in its centre. Some
farmers are making a living here despite the small bands of draconians and
hobgoblins. The lake is deep and crystal clear, with lots of fish. Some legend
says there is a monster down in the deep - a dragon-like turtle, or maybe a
turtle-like dragon? Many have found this to be a good place to settle down, so
you may find some strange people here.

GUILD OF DARKFRIENDS
Creator:      Kelvik

Size:         69

Dangers:      0 DT:s
Speedie:      Karandras: 3s2en3es
Thieves, assassins, smugglers, mercenaries... This is the place for people
with a shady profession and an unclear conscience. It is located in the
central parts of Karandras, but has their own laws. Don't expect help if you
enter, but do expect trouble. Should you make it past the killers, knifers,
beardogs and other obstacles, you will eventually find the grandmaster and his
pet panther... and probably wish you hadn't.
