DAMAGE:
=======
Id on a weapon will say something like this:
  Item is: ANTI-GOOD FORGED
  Weight: 12.0 lbs, Value: 43500
  Damage Dice is '9D3'
  Damage type is Bludgeoning  (WEAPON CRUSH FIRE)
  Can affect you as :
      Affects : DAMROLL By 6
      Affects : HITROLL By 3
      Affects : SLAY vs Human
This means....
  ANTI-GOOD: Weapon can't be used if you are good-aligned. Similar flags exist
          for neutral and evil.
  FORGED: Adds +1 to the weapon's damage (does not affect DR shown in stats).
  Weight: If heavy, you will need a certain strength to wield it. If it weighs
          25 lbs or less, even a gnome mage can wield it (once maxed strength),
          but for heavier weapons you might have problems.
  Damage Dice: 9D3 means "Throw nine 3-sided dice". A 3-sided die has 3 sides,
          1, 2 & 3. Average 2. So 9D3 has an average of 9 * 2 = 18.
          Minimum result 9 (all 1:s) and maximum result 27 (all 3:s).
          A y-sided dice rolls, on average, (y+1)/2
          Formula, xDy: Average = x * (y+1)/2
                        Min     = x
                        Max     = x * y
  Damage type is Xxx: This affects the output, ie what you see when fighting
          someone. Eg a "Bludgeoning" weapon deals pounding damage:
          "You vaporize <opponent> with your pound."
          The only real importance of this damage type is that rogues can't
          backstab with a weapon unless its damage type is "Pierce".
  (WEAPON CRUSH FIRE): These flags affects the damage you do, depending on your
          opponent's irv:s. Every weapon should have the "WEAPON" flag.
          Every (normal) weapon should also have either SLASH, CRUSH or PIERCE.
          If the weapon does special damage it can also have one or more of the
          other flags, like IRON, PURE, WATER, FIRE, WOOD,...
          Any flag that matches the opponent's vulnerabilities will increase
          total & max damage with 25% (cumulative).
          Any flag that matches the opponent's resistances will decrease
          total & max damage with 25% (cumulative).
          Any flag that matches the opponent's immunities will decrease the
          damage to 0.
  Affects : HITROLL By 3: Improves your hitroll
  Affects : DAMROLL By 6: Improves your damage. Added before irv is applied.
  Affects : SLAY vs <type>: Doubles your damage dice when fighting creatures
          of this type. So for the above example, when fighting humans the
          damage dice of 9D3 would be multiplied by 2.
Worth noting: A weapon with "Damage type is Piercing  (WEAPON)" can be used to
              backstab mobs that are immune to PIERCE.

-----

NWD = Normal Weapon Damage (whatever damage you do with your weapon).
Damage and Maxdam is NOT affected by stats
Maxdam for lvl 72 Te/Te: 451 + max_mana/13.3
Maxdam for lvl 64 Ma/Ma with 1706 maxmana: 661
Maxdam for Pr/Ma or Ma/Pr: (100 + extra_damage_skill + lvl/2) * (1 + <maxmana>/4800)
                       resist: 70/450
                Cindy  normal: 93/600
                       vuln:  116/750
                       manashield: 300 spelldamage and half weapon damage


If a mob has 95% chance of saving a spell for half damage, the expected
outcome will be: spelldamage * 0.525

slay = damage-dice * 2
vuln = damage * 1.25
Slay does not affect maxdamage.
Vulnerability improves maxdamage (and damage) by 25%.
Resistance decreases maxdamage (and damage) by 25%
Resistance (and vuln?) is added _after_ sanc calculation.
Race vuln is NOT cumulative with eq-vuln, so eg a troll can wear fire-vuln eq
without any added penalty.
I think a vuln and a resist cancel each other out, but you can't cancel a race
vuln and then add a resist. So a troll wearing one vuln-fire and one resist-
fire item is still vulnerable to fire, while if wearing two fire-resist items
I don't think he'll be resistant to fire. And a human putting on one vuln-fire
item and then two resist fire items will probably be resistant to fire.
But this is just a guess.

Max weapon damage through sanc: level/2 + 20, rounded down
Max skill damage through sanc : level/2 + 20, rounded down
Max spell damage through sanc : level/2 + 20, rounded down  +  maxmana/100, rounded up

XP:
===
xpgain: 1 xp per damage done (nothing for damaging self)

xploss for dt:ing at lvl 1-10:  2 * maxxp
xploss for dt:ing at lvl 50/1: 392  (9 -> -389)
xploss for dt:ing at lvl 56:    5000k
xploss for dt:ing at lvl 66+:   1250k

xploss for dying  at lvl   1:   0   (even with excess xp)
xploss for dying  at lvl   2-7: 1/10 of current xp, rounded down)
xploss for dying  at lvl   8:   50k (can never go below 0)
xploss for dying  at lvl 50/1:  0 (if on negative exp)
xploss for dying  at lvl 50/50: 5M-10M depending on number of stats bought.
xploss for dying  at lvl 59 19M?
xploss for dying  at lvl 66+:   (lvl-40)*250000

Above level 50, you will stop gaining xp once you reach 2.1B. 
Above level 50, you will/may drop in stats when dying, if below -200M xp?

Bringing 3 pets with you in a group, brings your xp down by 25%. Only leader
will suffer this xp-loss. The pets may gain more xp than these lost 25%.

MONEY:
======
Cost for buying corpse seems to be fixed and depend on level, until you reach
50/50. Then it depends on... the value of your eq? Buying corpse from a place
you cannot walk to (you need to use obelisk or enter portal or other object)
costs more.
Buying corpse with lvl  1-12, walkable place:  500*lvl
Buying corpse with lvl 16-22, walkable place: 2000*lvl
Buying corpse with lvl 50 Mthead, walkable place: 1398890
  Eq value: 656440 (approx), Inside bag: 487649 (approx), Sum: 1144089 (approx)
Buying corpse with lvl 50 Mthead, walkable place: 1570750
  Eq value: 664440, Inside bag: 756810, Sum: 1421250


SPELLS:
=======
Spellsave 2 gives 95% save against blindness, poison & curse. Probably same
  for most (all?) of the other spells too.
Each step in saves changes your chance of saving with 5%
The level of the spell/caster does not alter this chance.
The chance of saving a spell is never below 5% and never above 95%
There is always a 5% risk of the caster losing concentration
So: spell save 1 should be the lowest you will ever need, making you as safe
    as possible, even if you get cursed.

REGENERATION:
=============
Mana regen for Pr/Ma: 2(int+wis) + (lvl-24)  mana per rl minute (with maxed
age, standing up and without any other mana boosters).
Mana regen is NOT affected by maxmana.
Regenerate gives  +10% bonus to regen. Cumulative. (same bonus for hp regen)
Treeform   gives  +50% bonus to regen. Cumulative.
Outposts   gives  +50% bonus to regen. Cumulative. (regardless of outpost type)
Cos        gives  +25% bonus to regen. Cumulative.
Regen-aura gives +100% bonus to regen. Cumulative. (same bonus for hp regen)
Sitting    gives same manareg as standing
Resting    improves manaregen with 11.4% compared with standing ( *10/9 )
Sleeping   improves manaregen with 22.5% compared with standing ( *11/9 )
Reef's regen room improves regen-rate with average +229 mana/minute (irregular)

Lvl 89 test data:                                  RL value
Standard:          2(25+25) + (89-24)    = 165.0     165.3

Age:              Approx 44% higher at 79 years old compared to age 17

WEAPONS:
========
Weapon levels (uncertain):
Fighter has increased level for PIERCE weapons.
For anti-good flagged weapons, divide level by 1.15.
Each bonus to hitroll normally adds +2 level

Weapons without MAGIC flag can be forged.
The "enchant weapon" spell puts a MAGIC flag on the weapon and increases the
weapon's levels. The increase in levels depends on the power of the enchant
(and on whether the weapon gets an anti-good flag or not).

Enchants made by a good-aligned player puts an anti-evil flag on the weapon.
Enchants made by a neutral-aligned player puts no flag on the weapon.
Enchants made by an evil-aligned player puts an anti-good flag on the weapon.

If an enchant weapon scroll is used, the power of the enchant is based on the
level on the scroll, while the (possible) anti-align flag put on the weapon
depends on the alignment of the reciter, NOT the alignment of the scroll creator.


REPUTATION:
===========
Some of this data isn't certain, but I _think_ this is how it works:
* You start with 0 rep points.
* Every 100 rep points gives you 1% discount.
* Getting to a new 100-interval gives you a new rep title. After you've
  advanced a few steps, you will need 200 for each new title, and at the end
  you will need 300 for each new title.
* Max rep points is 3599, giving you 35% discount.
* Membership in a merc improves your discount by up to 10%, depending on the
  sum of the rep of the members in the merc. This sum is _maybe_ just taken
  from the members shown in "merc info <mercname>", not counting the rep of
  other chars from those accounts. You aren't considered a member (no crest
  and no discount) until you've reached lvl 20.
* Rep title depends on your alignment and your first class.
* Discount is applied when paying for ship between continents, in most npc
  shops, and when buying stats and levels above 50 (don't know about obelisk
  costs). For buying stats and levels, the discount is applied to the cost in
  both money and xp (you still need to get excess xp, but when you buy your
  level, the xp you earned by your discount is given back, so you'll start on
  your next level with some xp already earned).
* To figure out your discount, check the price of the fireball staff in the
  Kender Village magic shop. Unmodified price is 100k, so if your price is eg
  97k, you have 3% discount.
* At lvl 65+, your discount for buying level & practices is reduced. Formula
  for this is still unknown (seems like you get to keep approx 35% of your
  discount, but not exactly 35%. More like 34.889%)
* Bublina before getting lvl 65: 259M excess
           after getting lvl 65: Exp: 166M (needing 1433M)
  17-18% rep, + merc = 27%. 1/4 of this is 6.75%, and 6.75% of 1.5B = 101.25M
  101.25M + 259M/4 = 166M
  Illegal before getting lvl 65:  52M excess
           after getting lvl 65: Exp:  99M (needing 1501M)
  13-14% rep, + merc = 23%. 1/4 of this is 5.75%, and 5.75% of 1.5B =  86.25M
   86.25M +  52M/4 =  99M
  So: When gaining level 65, the cost is 1.5B xp, lowered by a fourth of your
      discount. And you get to keep 1/4 of your excess exp.
  Ie: <exp after leveling> = 0.25 * (1.5B * <discount> + <excess>)

CHARMIES:
=========
Charmies and pets:
  * Have varying stats.
  * Con does not affect hp
  * Dex does not affect moves
  * Int does not affect mana
  * Str skips the 18/X steps, but can't go above 30.
  * Str affects carry capacity and hr/dr
  * Dex affecting ac? Don't know.
  * Maxmana affects spell damage? Don't know.

Standard:
* Until you pass lvl 50, the highest level mob you can charm is your own
  level. When you pass lvl 50, the highest will be lvl 51. Somewhere above lvl
  57 the max is changed to 52 and somewhere below lvl 67 the max is changed to
  lvl 53. Nobody has sofar been able to charm a lvl 54+ mob.
* The time a charmie will stay charmed depends on his int, so a feeblemind
  (lowers his int to 3) before charming helps a lot.
* If you want to recharm, first order him to sit (so you can spell on him
  without risking that he'll flail) and have him wear some eq that ruins his
  saves (large dwarven shield from the tomb in southwest part of Juargan
  usually does the trick).
* Give your charmie a boat and some money, so you don't lose him when
  travelling over water or by navigators.
* If your charmie can't see invis, he may have problems either with you (if
  you are invis) or with your opponents (if they are invis). A detect invis
  potion fixes this.
* If your charmie doesn't seem to obey you, it's usually because charm has run
  out ("order followers smile" to check), or because he can't see the target
  ("order followers smile <target>").
* Any charmie can protect you. So if you want protection, just "order
  followers protect <yourname>".
* If you are attacked and a charmie is protecting you, you can improve your
  chance of getting rescued by "order followers rescue <yourname>". This will
  make him try an additional time to rescue you, above his standard protection
  try.
* I think all charmies can be ordered to kick, so if you don't have anything
  else you need to do, this can boost their damage a little bit.
* All charmies can recite scrolls. They are often poor at doing this during
  battle, but starting the battle with a damage scroll works just fine.
* Charmies can wear any eq allowed to be worn by a mage at the same level and
  with the same alignment as the charmie. Good eq kan improve your charmie a
  LOT, but there's always the risk of losing your charmie and the eq he's
  wearing.
* Weapons wielded by a charmie don't improve their damage with the hit dice,
  but elemental damage done by the weapon counts, as does all bonuses a weapon
  gives. So an enchanted low-level weapon is probably better than an
  unenchanted high-level one.
* When charm runs out, the charmie will still follow you, but won't obey any
  orders. If he's been set to protect you, he will keep doing so.

Good charmie mobs:
There are lots around! And how good they are depends on what you want them
for, what equipment you give them, whom you want to use it against etc. Mobs
that powerheal are often prefered since they will last long. Lvl 50 Paladin of the
third ring from Citadel of Order is a good choice. Just make sure you get the
one that does powerheal. For lowbies a lvl 33 Rhododen cadet may be of
interest (casts trueheal). The level 20 monk that casts miracle every round is
no longer charmable :-)
If you want to level up a lowbie, Foreman Floyd from Mob Factory is a good
choice if you can prepare" him first. There's a staff with lvl 40 charm, so by
first cursing Floyd, having him to wear eq that ruins his save and making him
sit, then ditching, anyone of any level can get him for a pet, using that
staff. Give him a cheap fire-headed mace and he'll clean out hobgoblin camps
for you.
If you are a lowbie and just want someone to stand in your way, a Rock slug
from Graveyard Plus might be a good deal. Great hp for his level, and resists
weapon.
For highbies interested in a good combination of damage dealing and tanking,
the Purple sand worm in Desert has been a valued companion. Nowadays the Sand
Snake in Reef seems to be the most popular one. Ceng in Dunheim went straight
to the top as (ab)used charmie nr 1 when he was introduced. He's been
downgraded conciderably, but is still a great charmie.
Paladin of the third ring has always been a good choice and probably always
will, thanks to its combination of damage- and healing spells.
And if you want to experiment, you could try a Maid from Dunheim. She doesn't
hit too hard but has a lot of attacks, so with some eq she may become deadly.
And for mana, I prefer using Revenants in Underdark.
To find out which mob is on todays hotlist, just locate "dwarven" and check
out which mobs are wearing that large dwarven shield (charmie item no. 1)

Advanced:
Some of these things _could_ be considered abuse. But imms know about these
possibilities as well as many players. Better to let everyone know, imho.
* To kill a mob doing non-normal damage, it can be a lot easier if you use a
  mob that is immune to that type of damage. Some mobs do a certain damage
  naturally, as does any mob with a weapon that does special damage. If the
  mob doesn't cast any nasty spells, any mob immune to that type will be
  sufficient. Ex: A level 1 fish is enough to tank Poseidon (though you must
  probably have the fish quaff a detect-invis potion to be able to attack him,
  or attack yourself and have the fish rescue you). A pixie is enough to bring
  down King Tomaaukkhen, if you can deliver the damage needed).
* Some mobs with weapons have been "fixed" so they remove their weapon if
  fighting an immune charmie. Not all, though. Tomaaukkhen doesn't do this.
  Poseidon does, but a powerblind will take care of that.
* Mobs like to switch target and attack the one controlling the charmie. Any
  mob can do this, even if they can't normally switch target. This can be
  removed by disbanding right after having ordered your charmie to attack.
  This will stop the mob from doing any switch-to-controller. However, if the
  mob has the ability to switch, or if you use backstab/murder, your opponent
  may still switch to you. In this case it's up to you to decide if you want
  to wait and hope for the mob to switch back, or perhaps just flee, go back
  and attack again, from behind your former charmie.
* For extra protection you can order your charmie to protect you before the
  fight. ANY charmie can be set to protect you. And this setting will stay
  even after he's been ditched.
* If you want to try an army, charm a guard in King's castle (they assist
  eachother). Have it protect you. When charm runs out, charm another guard,
  then another and another, etc. Whenever you attack a mob, the guard you
  charmed first will rescue you and the other guards will then assist him.
  When all guards of interest have been charmed, you can still afford to charm
  one more mob, That you keep under your control. Kerish and I did this, and
  in the end we had 5 guards (one set to protect me), Goldmoon (set to protect
  Kerish), a paladin of the 3:rd ring (controlled by me) and 3 spectres.
  Result: A 10 10-mob-2-pc army! (and they all died when we tried King Rok).

================
Dodge is checked first.
Parry is checked second.
Ac is checked third.
  Chance for mob to hit = (mob hr - mob thac0 - your ac + 20) * 5 %
                          (min 5%, max 95%)

LERONAH QUEST REWARDS:
======================
Lvl below 50/50 gets X * max-xp (NOT divided by 3 for multiclass)
Lvl 50/50 gets X * 1M xp
Lvl 51/51 gets X * 1.2M xp
Lvl 52/52 gets X * 1.4M xp
Lvl 53/53 gets X * 1.6M xp
Lvl 54/54 gets X * 1.8M xp
Lvl 55/55 gets X * 2.0M xp
 diff -8 to -5: X = 2
 diff -4 to  0: X = 3
 diff  1 to  5: X = 4
Lvl 56+ gets 1 or 2 qp. Probable formula: 1 qp if (1d20 > 10+diff)
So, the chance of getting 2 qp is 25% if the mob is 5 levels below, 50% if
the same level and 75% for creatures 5 levels above you.
If you gain level before killing, max-xp and level-diff are recalculated.


ITEM STORE:
===========
Each level adds 2 slots to the item store.
Each level as multiclass adds 2 slots to the item store.
Each level past 50 adds 4 slots to the item store.
All characters in your account are summed up.


HINTS & TRICKS:
===============
* To find if a hidden door in a room, looking in all six direction seems
  like a nearly infallible method. Ie, "look north", "look south", "look
  up" etc.
* If a mob has a strange description and you don't know his name, you can
  try exa 1."", exa 2."", etc and you will be able to look at him. Usually
  he is 2."" if you are alone, since the last person entering a room (which
  probably is you) is 1.""
* Found stuff and don't know who it belongs to? The items are probably
  marked, so try to donate the least important item in the pile (a bread or
  a barrel, eg) and you will get a "You can't donate it, since it belongs
  to Cindy". This way you can figure out the owner and just mail the whole
  lot and get rid of it.
* Buying con early or late does _NOT_ affect your hit points in the end.
  This goes for both normal con and the one bought for frags. Thanks Virus
  for clearing this out!
* Immortals are never wrong.
* On NC, in 3 Mages, there is a looking pool. You can "look <mob/player>"
  and see the room that mob/player is in.
* With the "locate object" spell you can locate outposts too. Nice way of
  finding a place to rest. Feel free to tell me "locate outpost", for an
  updated list.
* Dwarves are NOT vulnerable to energy. The fact that people use ghostly
  spears & swords against dwarves is NOT for their ENERGY flag, but for their
  MAGIC flag (they are vulnerable to MAGIC).
* There's a large pirate treaure in Venden that pops each boot. If you need
  money, you might want to check it out. Even a level 1 char can safely get
  that treasure.
* If the flowing blue longsword is on a trainer, it is always on the
  southernmost trainer in hobgoblin camps.
* Everful pouch & mug are rare, but very useful for lowbies. Found on Satyrs
  in Enchanted Forest. Satyrs can't be summoned, but the pouch & mug can at
k
  least be located with 'locate object' spell. Everfuls can spawn during
  gameplay, if the satyrs have been killed.
* An oak leaf symbol held as light will keep your belly happy forever.
* Fire breath can VAPORIZE equipment. It always vapes the top item in your
  inventory. So do not have anything valuable as top item. Especially not
  your bag with all your needed items. I'd suggest keeping a canoe as the
  top item in your inventory (or at least above your container), since it's
  easy to replace if vaporized and EVERYONE should carry a BOAT. Yes, even
  mages!
* Most spellcasters have triggers to automatically cast spells on you when
  you ask them. If you don't know how this works, ask someone about it.
  Whenever you see me on FS, feel free to (ab)use my triggers. If you want
  help on how to use them, just "ask cindy info" and feel free to test all
  my triggers.
* If you need a weapon enchant, "ask cindy scribe enchant weapon".
* If you want to know if an item is loaded, "tell cindy locate <item>
  [<keyword>]".
  Example: "tell cindy locate pink doll" (I will then locate "pink" and return
  every hit containing the word "doll", ie you will see if the pink ice ring
  is loaded on any of the old dolls).
* If you use TinyFugue and want an extra window that shows the map of the area
  you are in, automatically switching the map whenever you enter a new area,
  have a look at areaviewer.tf in the /tf directory.
* If you want to download all map files neatly packed, try the file
  0maps_061207.tar in the /maps directory.
* The navigator summoned from the Milorai obelisk can transport you to NC.
  To move a whole group to NC (leader must be Ktv), you bring the group to
  the thalos obelisk, leave east (so group is still by the obelisk), find
  the navigator and enter Milorai. Rub the obelisk to summon the navigator,
  and then "transport thalos" quickly followed by "transport myrridon". Done!
* If you haven't solved the quest Rainbow after the Rain, you can quickly get
  from NC to OC, by joining the quest, getting into the quest area and then
  recall (bringing you to Karandras). This, unfortunately, can't be used to
  bring a whole group.
  If you're sneaky, you can instead try the Demon King in Narnia - sneak in
  and "enter bones" before he attacks you, and you will also get to Karandras.
  But fail and you _will_ die (noexit & norecall, can't enter bones when
  fighting).
* If you're looking for hidden treasures: The chance of sensing something
  buried when looking is bigger than the chance of finding something when
  digging. And looking is fast. So look several times, and don't bother to
  dig unless "You sense something buried here.".
* One of the above hints is a total, complete and obvious lie. The rest are
  things I believe in, but that doesn't mean they're true.
* Cloudkill cast by mobs will damage other mobs in the room, within the level
  limited by the spell. Which eg means that V'rama Vair can often be killed by
  the minions he himself summoned. So if you find a tough mob that casts
  cloudkill, you can summon other suitable mobs to his room, and once he casts
  the spell, all these mobs will get hit and start fighting him.
