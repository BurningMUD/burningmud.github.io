My guess is that date isn't calculated from the internal clock
since it can change within the same clock-second. Not sure how it works,
nor do I know if time proceeds on Burning when the game is down.

I also guess that the mud started on year 0 or 1, so it might be possible
to use the current date to find out when Burning was born :-)


Age:
You start out being 17 years old.
Every 2 RL weeks you become one year older.
Age affects hp regen negatively once you've passed 45 years. When you are 80
years old it is at its lowest, but then it starts going up again, and when
you reach 115 it's back at max, where it will stay forever(?)
Age affects mana regen positively (if older you regen faster). At 79 you have
reached maximum mana regen.
There are items that can affect your age. It is possible to have negative age.
There are a few items that can change your age permanently (copper flask(+1d4), adam's apple(+2d4) & iron flask(-1d4)). Iron flasks can't be quaffed if you are 17 years old, so there's a limit to how young you can be (17 minus all age-decreasing eq).
