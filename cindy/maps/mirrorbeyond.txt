Detrom                    97       N--x    1 GN     ?           0      INFO, [human], Only appears when someone enters his room. NOT vuln heal but starts at awful and gains hp when you hurt him. Dies when on full hp. Does not seem to be vuln light, but maybe vuln pure? Murder messes up so he dies "badly" without dogtags. Room is noflee, but recall and summon out works. If nobody is in the room he returns to corpse-state (item) and when reappearing he has lost any bad spells cast on him, and health is probably reset too.
