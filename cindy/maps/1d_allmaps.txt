* Entrance alley, Burroughs and north houses are very bright.
* W: Skeletal Warriors in these rooms. Agg if you stay >5 seconds.
* Pool: Use "look <name>" to look at a player or mob (max your level)
* Fount: Full mana-restore & 1-3 ticks paralyze (mark it on the map)
* Fount regains ? charges every ? minutes and has ? max-charges
* RoS: Room of Summoning - Its special has been removed.

*   also another try, so you can get more than one potion in the same boot.

* Many rooms are very bright
* Many moving, aggressive bodyguards & draconians (vuln unlife)
* Tip: Open the door east to Red & Green dragon, and eventually all aggressive
*      draconians and bodyguards will gather there, making the rest of the
*      area a lot safer.

special:         Miscellaneous useful information about the mob (see list below).

Mob XP:
=======
I don't have access to the code, so this is just my guess on how xp works. And
it seems to work like this:

XP gained = <mob xp> / <your level>
IF you are multi, divide XP by 3
If your level >= 65, divide XP by 4
IF your level > mob level AND your level > 50, lower XP by 1/3
IF mob is withered, lower XP by 1/3
IF you are in a group, the <mob xp> should be divided by by the highest level
   in the group (not with <your level>).
   And then you also have to multiply with your percentage (5% means *0.05).
IF you are templar, xp might be different for different mob aligns, but the
   numbers for this is unknown to me. And it looks like Templars do get the
   exact same xp as other classes.

So, the xp listed is what a single-classed lvl 1 non-templar would get for
killing the mob solo, without using wither. Since xp is only given in whole
numbers and I'll need calculations to get the original xp, there will be
some rounding errors - don't expect the values to be exact. I'm adding k/M/B
to the end, cutting the number to max 4 digits.

My guess is that you will get the actual xp the mob has (only visible by imm-
stat:ing the mob) by dividing this xp with the mob's level. But this is just
speculation.

When in groups, your share is shown correctly in the group listing, _except_
if the group contains pets. (have not bothered checking if charmies work or
not).
Mob xp is set by the creator, but it seems to go (VERY vaguely) around the
formula: Lvl^4*5

Mob thac-X=11:
==============
Means that the mob has to roll at least 11 on a 20 sided dice to manage to
hit you if you have armor class -X.
So if you have -X in armor class, the mob will hit you 50% of the times.
Each step difference from this -X armor class means a 5% change in the mob's
chance to hit you, so if you are more than 8 steps from -X, the mob will have
5% or 95% chance to hit you.

Mob AC:
=======
Your chance of hitting the mob depends on his armor class (ac) compared with
your ability to hit him (thac0 modified by hr).
thac0 4 means you must roll at least 4 on a 20 sided dice to manage to hit
him, if he has armor class 0. Each hr you get lowers the number needed by 1,
and each step downwards in ac the mob gets, raises the number by one.
So to calculate a mob's ac, take your thac0 minus your hitroll, minus your
miss-percentage divided by 5, minus 1.
Example:
Thac0 -7 and hr +43  =>  thac0 -50
146 misses out of 175 (83.4%): 85/5 + 1 = 18 (must roll at least 18 on a d20)
-50-18 = -68, so mob has AC -68
Note: You always have min 5% and max 95% hitchance, so calculationg ac is only
reliable if you are within the 10%-90% range.
SIMPLY PUT: Skip the signs. If your HR+thac0 = mob AC, you will always hit.
            Each step below means 5% less chance.

Mob Save:
=========
Save X = Roll X or higher on a d20 to make a successful save.
Save 11 means the mob has 50% chance to save against your spell.
Save 2 gives 95% save against spells. Each step in save changes your chance
of saving with 5%. The level of the spell/caster does not alter this chance.
The chance of saving a spell is never below 5% and never above 95%.
Save <2 means you have max even if cursed.

* A number of creature types have no matching slay-weapon. Or none suitable
  for testing. These are:
    Amphibian, Astral, Beholder, Bird, Canine, Dinosaur, Elemental, Entity,
    Fairie, Feline, Fish, Half-Orc, Hobbit, Insect, Insubstantial, Jelly,
    Ktv, Lizardman, Reptile, Rodent, Skeleton, Spider
  For these, mobs have been pinned with those types anyway, if their irv:s
  match and their descriptions point towards it.
* Entity has same irv:s as mythical. Any mob marked "entity" has the irv:s
  matching, and is not mythical.


Useful to know when checking:
=============================
fire breath   => can VAPE eq!
Immune dark   => immune blindness  ("Your victim is immune to your spell.")
Immune unlife => immune wither     ("Your victim is immune to your spell.")
"somewhat resilient" to blindness => resist dark
Resistance to unlife will NOT give a warning when using wither on the mob.
It is possible to poison a mob that is immune to poison: No damage is taken
per tick and no "looks really sick" messages will show, but it's seen with
the "detect poison" spell and regen rate is slowed.
Wither on Resist unlife: 80% of old maxhp
Wither on Normal:        2/3 of old maxhp
Wither on Vuln unlife:   50% of old maxhp
no-charm & NOT thief     => immune blind
NOTE: Immune blind does not _HAVE_ to implicate immunity to dark
Agg-sleeper means the mob is agg-all and has a wimpy-flag (flees)
mountable => leadable
water-living => Can't enter non-water rooms even with fly
Lvl X cloudkill     works on mobs of lvl (X-2) / 2, rounded down
Lvl 88 cloudkill    works on mobs of lvl 1-43
At lvl 66-92, charm works on lvl 53 mobs but NOT on lvl 54 mobs
A successful energy drain gives you <target's level> * 3.75 mana, rounded
down (minus the casting cost of 20).

Dies when on full hp. Does not seem to be vuln light, but maybe vuln pure? Murder messes up so he dies "badly" without dogtags.

* North part and the towers are very bright
* Very nice area. Lots of different mobs and items. Most mobs are humans.
* Getting to top of the towers gives seals that can be given to the king for
* a reward. Right tower is just fighting, but left can be climbed peacefully.

Vell hi!: Room is norecall/nosum/nosumout with no exits. Has a lvl 60 bear
without eq(?). Caerlin and the masters in west tower used to go there when
they die.

Vell, hi!
This is the hideout of Bear D. Bear....a VERY weird creature if there ever
was one.  You're not supposed to be here....trust me.  I know.  I wrote this
area :-).  Anyway, better recall or get someone to transfer you out of here,
'cause this is just a room used by mobprogs.....
(P.S.  Bear D. Bear is Merriman's sister's teddy bear.....*cackle*)
Obvious exits: [None]
(Cuteness) Dee big byoo bear hulks and yerks in the corner, wrinkling and folding at ebry motion. (invisible)

Bear: Lvl 60:
Bear-de-bear seems to be an armyess, yegyess, neckyess byob of material viss 
drawn-on pfeatures and a sishy guvuhvin vich erases the aura of ebilness in his
pshadovy form.  Psort of.  Onyee his faice can be pseen, as dee rest of him is
enveyoped in a pcheckered guvuhveen bag and hood dat cobers his tiny ears.
Bear-de-bear is in excellent condition.

* Whole area (except sw dump) is very bright
* Shops open at 5 am and close at 9 pm.
* Glimmering rift, moving around in Myrridon: 1 room with Thorn demon.
* Nasty aggies in dump (sw), shards (ne), shaman (s), and some aggressive
* thugs in the centre. Plus the tower elite guards are agg-evil.
* Normal guards are protectors, and maybe the big lvl 85 knight is too.
* Most mobs are human - vuln slay human. Children steal money!

* Min level 0/45
* Interesting xp-area. Not without dangers.
* SD: Noexit/norecall room (get summon out of there).

* The sharn area (through torturer portal) is norecall, but you can be
* summoned out from and in to the area. The rooms in the middle "loop"!

* Max level 0/7
* Pixies are immune to pure/light. No known vulns.
* Safe area. Nice place for lvl 1-7, but be careful with the spellcasters,
* since they hurt a lot at low levels.
* Best way to kill queen: Use l.bolt scrolls from the Atlantis magic shop

* Min level 0/32
* Toll-Gate room is very bright. Beware Zarak - nasty backstabber.
* Ancient ghosts are vuln energy but immune to pierce. All 3 in the same room,
*  but once they've been in fight, they will start moving around.
*  Once killed, the wand bearer spawns on the "f"?

* Moves every 6 hour. Can be tracked with a 'compass' (item found in well)
* Can also be entered through Milo'rai
*
* Compass: Points toward the well. Direction is shown by a number (0-359).
*   0: Straight north
*  90: Straight east (or not possible to walk to without using portal/ship)
* 180: Straight south
* 270: Straight west
* Compass looks for the closest route and then calculates the direction,
* counting each step to be of equal length. Note that many areas overlap, so
* even if you find the exact spot, you might not find it (then it's in another
* area of the same longitude & latitude)
