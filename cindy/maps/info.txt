Mob info:
=========
Sorting: Level first, then name
Name: as seen in "<name> is in excellent condition."
Lvl: Level
Xp:  Mob Xp (see explanation below)
A: Alignment     G/N/E
S: Sanced        x/-
W: Walking       x/-
I: see Invis     x/-
D: see Darkness  x/-
M: Memory        x/-
X: Switch        0/1/2/... (max normal switches in a round)
#: Number        MAX number of mobs of that type
Agg: Aggie       G/-, N/-, E/-. Example: "G-E" means aggressive against good & evil chars.
Hp: Hit points   <lowest hp seen>-<highest hp seen>. This is the mob's max-hp (the ones inside paranthesis when he does a "ps"). A "~" before the sum means hp has been calculated by killing and looking at total damage (ie, some healing-time may be included).
gold:            <lowest amount found>-<highest amount found>
special:         Miscellaneous useful information about the mob (see list below).

Mob XP:
=======
I don't have access to the code, so this is just my guess on how xp works. And
it seems to work like this:

XP gained = <mob xp> / <your level>
IF you are multi, divide XP by 3
If your level >= 65, divide XP by 4
IF your level > mob level AND your level > 50, lower XP by 1/3
IF mob is withered, lower XP by 1/3
IF you are in a group, the <mob xp> should be divided by by the highest level
   in the group (not with <your level>).
   And then you also have to multiply with your percentage (5% means *0.05).
IF you are templar, xp might be different for different mob aligns, but the
   numbers for this is unknown to me. And it looks like Templars do get the
   exact same xp as other classes.

So, the xp listed is what a single-classed lvl 1 non-templar would get for
killing the mob solo, without using wither. Since xp is only given in whole
numbers and I'll need calculations to get the original xp, there will be
some rounding errors - don't expect the values to be exact. I'm adding k/M/B
to the end, cutting the number to max 4 digits.

My guess is that you will get the actual xp the mob has (only visible by imm-
stat:ing the mob) by dividing this xp with the mob's level. But this is just
speculation.

When in groups, your share is shown correctly in the group listing, _except_
if the group contains pets. (have not bothered checking if charmies work or
not).
Mob xp is set by the creator, but it seems to go (VERY vaguely) around the
formula: Lvl^4*5

Mob thac-X=11:
==============
Means that the mob has to roll at least 11 on a 20 sided dice to manage to
hit you if you have armor class -X.
So if you have -X in armor class, the mob will hit you 50% of the times.
Each step difference from this -X armor class means a 5% change in the mob's
chance to hit you, so if you are more than 8 steps from -X, the mob will have
5% or 95% chance to hit you.

Mob AC:
=======
Your chance of hitting the mob depends on his armor class (ac) compared with
your ability to hit him (thac0 modified by hr).
thac0 4 means you must roll at least 4 on a 20 sided dice to manage to hit
him, if he has armor class 0. Each hr you get lowers the number needed by 1,
and each step downwards in ac the mob gets, raises the number by one.
So to calculate a mob's ac, take your thac0 minus your hitroll, minus your
miss-percentage divided by 5, minus 1.
Example:
Thac0 -7 and hr +43  =>  thac0 -50
146 misses out of 175 (83.4%): 85/5 + 1 = 18 (must roll at least 18 on a d20)
-50-18 = -68, so mob has AC -68
Note: You always have min 5% and max 95% hitchance, so calculationg ac is only
reliable if you are within the 10%-90% range.
SIMPLY PUT: Skip the signs. If your HR+thac0 = mob AC, you will always hit.
            Each step below means 5% less chance.

Mob Save:
=========
Save X = Roll X or higher on a d20 to make a successful save.
Save 11 means the mob has 50% chance to save against your spell.
Save 2 gives 95% save against spells. Each step in save changes your chance
of saving with 5%. The level of the spell/caster does not alter this chance.
The chance of saving a spell is never below 5% and never above 95%.
Save <2 means you have max even if cursed.

      parry/dodge means parry if mob is wielding a weapon, dodge otherwise.
                  Might be that all mobs have just a parry/dodge skill and
                  the action depends on whether they wield a weapon or not.
                  Addendum: Coven High-Priestess can do both, but dodged in
                    last battle even though she had an athame.
                    Zandy dodged when having spear - hass parried earlier.
                    Lurk dodged when having Skaven. Can he parry?
                  Maybe it's just random?

[creaturetype]:
===============
Used if mob is vuln to a certain slay damage. He is then expected to have the
default irv:s of that creaturetype too. Any deviations from those irv:s are
listed after [creaturetype].

also resistant to earth):

* A number of creature types have no matching slay-weapon. Or none suitable
  for testing. These are:
    Amphibian, Astral, Beholder, Bird, Canine, Dinosaur, Elemental, Entity,
    Fairie, Feline, Fish, Half-Orc, Hobbit, Insect, Insubstantial, Jelly,
    Ktv, Lizardman, Reptile, Rodent, Skeleton, Spider
  For these, mobs have been pinned with those types anyway, if their irv:s
  match and their descriptions point towards it.
* Entity has same irv:s as mythical. Any mob marked "[entity]" has the irv:s
  matching, and is not mythical.


Useful to know when checking:
=============================
fire breath   => can VAPE eq!
Immune dark   => immune blindness  ("Your victim is immune to your spell.")
Immune unlife => immune wither     ("Your victim is immune to your spell.")
"somewhat resilient" to blindness => resist dark
Resistance to unlife will NOT give a warning when using wither on the mob.
It is possible to poison a mob that is immune to poison: No damage is taken
per tick and no "looks really sick" messages will show, but it's seen with
the "detect poison" spell and regen rate is slowed.
Wither on Resist unlife: 80% of old maxhp
Wither on Normal:        2/3 of old maxhp
Wither on Vuln unlife:   50% of old maxhp
no-charm & NOT thief     => immune blind
NOTE: Immune blind does not _HAVE_ to implicate immunity to dark
Agg-sleeper means the mob is agg-all and has a wimpy-flag (flees)
mountable => leadable
water-living => Can't enter non-water rooms even with fly
Lvl X cloudkill     works on mobs of lvl (X-2) / 2, rounded down
Lvl 88 cloudkill    works on mobs of lvl 1-43
Lvl 100 cloudkill   works on mobs of lvl 1-49
At lvl 66-100, charm works on lvl 53 mobs but NOT on lvl 54 mobs
A successful energy drain gives you <target's level> * 3.75 mana, rounded
down (minus the casting cost of 20). So to get level: (/ managain+20 3.75), rounded up.
(does not seem to work perfectly for lower levels)
