; This script reduces the spam when looking in your container, gagging all 
; "standard" items and only showing non-standard ones. Also, it warns if any
; standard item is missing. One of the weapons is assumed to be missing (since
; you you will always wield one), so weapons are only warned about if more
; than one item is missing from the bage.
;
; Potions/scrolls running out will be warned about as soon as there are few
; enough to not be compacted into one line (for me that means when there's
; only 2 left). I've chosen not to gag my homesick onions, since I want to
; keep that number a lot larger.
;
; To make this work, all the variables listed below must be set. Weapons must
; be listed first, and the list of other items must follow. Don't forget to
; update the variables bagweaponsum & bagallsum when you change the number of
; items in that list.
; Also, the trigger "ebamarkstart" must match the first line you see when you
; examine your bag, so if it doesn't, you need to change it
;
; usage:
; eba:  Look in your container. Gag all standard items
; eba2: Look in your container. Gag only weapons
; eba3: Look in your container. No gags
