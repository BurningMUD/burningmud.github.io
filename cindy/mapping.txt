Beginners Guide to Mapping.

I'm an explorer. My main goal is to map every area. I hope there are
others like me out there and by this note I'm hoping to get a few
more hooked.
Most places are easy to map, but as an explorer you will encounter a few
obstacles. Here are a few tips for newbie explorers:

Starter tips:
Most areas have some sign at the entrance, telling you which area
you're about to enter. Or it may be shown just by looking at the
room description. Check with the "help area" before entering. If it
says 50+++, be vewy, vewy careful or you'll end up vewy, vewy dead.
ALWAYS bring recall scrolls (recall potions/herbs are even better,
since if you are in a fight you may fail to read a scroll, but you
will rarely fail to put something in your mouth)
GET A BOAT, GET A BOAT, GET A BOAT! Boats are cheap and not very heavy.
There is _no_ reason not to bring a boat, _even_ if you have the
fly-spell.
----------

Mazes:
Pretty easy once you get the hang of it. Just drop 1 coin in the first
room you enter, 2 coins in the next _empty_ room you enter, and then
keep increasing the amount. Remember that going north then south
doesn't always take you back to where you were before.
If the maze is really messy, here's an example of an easy way to
record it:

Room  n  s  w  e  u  d
1     1 OUT 2  1  -  -
2     1  1  -  -  2  3
3     -  -  3  4     5
4           5     -  -
5     4  5     -  1  -

Interpretation:
The first room entered has been named "1". I have dropped one coin there
to mark the room. The room has exits in all four directions but no
up or down exit. Going north or east from room 1 leads back to the same
room. South leads out and west leads to room 2 (guess how many coins
I've dropped there :-)
Room 2: Has exits north and south (leading back to room 1), up (leading
to itself) and down (leading to room 3).
Room 3 has exits west, east, up and down. The up exit has not been
explored yet.
Room 4 has four exits and only the west exit has been checked.
Room 5 has four exits, with only the west exit unexplored.

Let's say you are standing in room 1 atm (you see 1 coin on the ground)
and want to continue your mapping. Let's start with the up exit in room
3. Go w to room 2, then d to get to room 3 and finally up. This room
has a pile of coins in it. Great! We've been here before. Pick up the
coins to see how many they were and then drop them again. Let's say
there were two coins. That means you are in room 2, and so the line
3    -  -  3  4     5
...will now be complete:
3    -  -  3  4  2  5
Next: Go down to room 3, east to room 4 then north. The room you now
entered is a room with only north and south exit. No money on the ground.
Change the line:
4          5     -  -
...into:
4    6     5     -  -
Also drop 6 coins in the room to "mark" it. Add the line
6          -  -  -  -
...then go south and check out that room.
Keep doing like this until the map is complete.
This method is simple and safe, and when done you will be certain that
no obvious exit has been missed.

Unfortunately more than one coin on the ground is shown as  "a small
pile of coins",... so the only way to know the exact number is to pick
them up and then drop them again. Still, its much easier than dropping
different items in each room. If you feel rich, you can instead buy
eg recall scrolls and drop 1 of them in the first room, 2 in the next
etc. Then, when looking in a room you will be able to see the number
of scrolls without picking them up.

Some mobs pick up stuff left on the ground, which may make things
a bit harder, but keep working and you'll eventually get your map.
The Great Eastern Desert is a perfect place to practice this method
When finished, you'll have found the Ruins of Thalos, lair of a brass
dragon, a nomad camp, the Pyramid, a DT and a few other nice places.
Don't try Astral Plane if you're new to this. That's a _tough_ place
to map.
----------

Locked doors:
Kill and loot all mobs you see (if you can). Once you've explored the
whole area you will hopefully have found the key. If not, you could
try asking a rogue for help.
If none of this works works (like the locked, unpickable door in
Mob Factory), then i don't know. Any suggestions?
----------

Aggressive mobs: 
Being invisible may help, but some mobs will still see you and attack.
If they are small, kill & loot!
If they are too tough, recall and check out the other rooms in the
area.
If they move around. Try again later. Maybe they've moved away from
those unexplored rooms?
If you can sneak, try getting past the mob that way.
If all else fails, you can always enter the room, check "exits" and
flee, hoping to flee into another unexplored (and hopefully safe) room.
With some luck you will be able to determine which way you fled by
checking out the names on the exits and the room name.
BEWARE! When you flee you will get a small waitstate before you can
do anything, so this method is risky. If the room you flee into also
has an aggressive mob, you may die. But in the name of discovery... :-)
----------

Death Traps:
Wonderful little rooms that makes life so much more interesting. For
those of you still in the dark, a death trap (DT) is a room where you
are instantly killed, with no chance of survival.
Luckily, this death isn't as "real" nor as painful as the real(?) ones.
You lose less xp and you get to keep all your equipment. If you hit
a DT, DON'T ask people for a corpse retrieval ;-)
Note: A room with 20 aggressive mobs is NOT a DT - only very painful.

If you, when checking "exits", find a room called "Eaten alive", "Killed
by stupidity" or "Burning death", it might be a good idea to slow down
a bit and start using those braincells of yourse. Does that exit lead to
a DT or not? Here are some ways on how to find out:

1. Look at the room description again (you _do_ read those descriptions,
right?). You might get some indications by descriptions like: "In the
center lies a bottomless hole - it would be VERY unwise to enter it". 
2. If it's "too dark to see" it's _not_ a DT (unless someone with a
wicked mind has created a room with that room name). The room name of a
DT is _always_ shown when you do "exits".
3. If you have seen "[INFO] Cindy hit a death trap at (...that room name)"
it is probably a DT.
4. Look in that direction. You may get a hint from the response.
5. Peek into the room. No exits means it's probably a DT.
6. (Make someone else) Enter the room. This is, as far as I know, the
only way to be sure.
----------

Secret exits:
This is, as I see it, the worst problem you face as a mapper. How to
make sure you don't miss any of those hidden places. Some are easy to
find. Others are a real pain to figure out. And maybe (hopefully) there
are a few left undiscovered.

Earlier you could do: open "" north   to open any exit north. Doing this
would open any hidden door north or tell you that the exit was locked.
So doing this for each direction would reveal all secret exits except
those you had to "enter" to get inside (like tree, well etc). And
those could usually be found by doing "get all".
Nowadays those hard-to-find places have been hidden better, the "get all"
strategy seldom works and trying to open "" in any direction will
always fail. So, what to do now?

Here are a few tips.
* Check "exits". That will show you all non-hidden exits.
* Try "get all". Any item you can't pick up may be possible to "enter"
* Walk in all other directions (n, s, u, d, e, w) and see if you bump
into something closed. This will show any not-so-hidden exit.
* Try "open secret", "open hidden", trap, door, ...  You may get lucky.
* Look at your map. Does it look like a room or two is "missing"?
* Look at the room description and objects in the room. Any clues?
* Get a general idea of the area by looking at every room description.
Does it look like something is missing? Castles usually has a "queen"
and a "king". Low-life scum holdouts often has some kind of "leader".
A mage tower should have some "mage" inside. Use the "where" command and
see if you've missed any mob"

If you still believe there is an exit here and haven't found it:
Try  open a, open b, open c, open d,... It might help. Eg, if there's a
"trapdoor" in the room, the "open t" command will make you open that
trapdoor. Unfortunately this will not work if you are carrying eg a
"trident" (you will then try opening your trident :-)

Really stubborn:
open a north, open b north, open c north,..., open a east, open b east,...

Really, really stubborn:
Do all of the above, plus enter a, enter b, enter c,...

Simple solution that seems to work on burning: Look n, look s, look e,
look w, look u, look d. If there is a doorway in any direction, it will
say "\<door\> is open/closed."
----------

I will NOT be held responsible for any deaths due to accidentaly (yeah,
right!) entering homes of demons, tree lords, Death Traps etc.
Nor will I replace lost money, eq, limbs, minds or souls.
In the end it's all up to your own bad judgement.
Don't be afraid: There are NO mobs that can kill you instantly... almost
no mobs... not more that three or four... per area... hopefully?
Be curious. Lionheart is your best friend.

PS. Have I missed anything? Please tell me if you have any smart ideas.
I still have a lot to learn in this area.

More good things:
* If you can't pick up an item because it's "too heavy", try bury it. If you
can't, the item has no-take flag.

* If you find lots of eq on the grund, it may belong to a player. To find out
if this is the case and whom the owner is, try sacrificing/donating a useless
item (scroll or potion, eg). If it says "You can't do that, the <item> belongs
to <name>!" your questions have been answered.

* Rooms _can_ have hidden items that you can't see, even when using "get all",
eg "hidden compartment" in Graveyard (holds a key) and "drawers" in Amber Keep
(also holds a key)

* If you see a mob but can't figure out his name, try using 'exa 2.""'.
Normally exa 1."" will examine yourself, exa 2."" will examine first mob in
the room, exa 3."" will examine next, etc.
