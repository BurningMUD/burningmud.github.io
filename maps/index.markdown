## Karandras Home Town Map

Karandras is the default starting point for all players, and remains the most popular city in the game and acts as a central hub for grouping up. The maps here are from the in-game map, which is given to all new characters upon creation. If you need help navigating or have any questions, the gossip channel is a good place to ask other players for some advice, or just contact an immortal directly in-game, as the immortals are here to help.
