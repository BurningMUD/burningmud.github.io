* <<< LETTER FROM Cassandra (a discarded letter) >>>
* My dearest love,
* Lady Nyraan has summoned all of our dead from the cemetary.  All of the farm
* animals have been slaughtered.  Scavengers have come and eaten the corpses of
* our wildstock...even Bessy.  She's gone my love, she's gone.  What can we 
* live for anymore?  Our farm is completely destroyed by the dark magics.  The
* mansion was always a front for the evil that Lady Nyraan was really up to. 
* How could we have never seen it?  I am headed to Myrridon to see if I can
* recruit some adventurers to clear these fields and rid us of Lady Nyraan once
* and for all. Please don't reveal to Lady Nyraan that we are aware of her
* evil deeds until I return!
*                                                 Love Always,
*                                                      Cassandra
*
* Rowlik is in north part, Lady in south-east I believe
