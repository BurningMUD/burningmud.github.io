Burning MUD is a completely free, text-based online multiplayer game. All players login and play together in the same world!

Burning is a PvE Hack m' Slash MUD, with optional PvP inside special arenas for fun!

Come have some fun and play casually or dive deep into the depth of the games content and systems. Burning is not a roleplaying MUD in the sense that you can chat about whatever you want in-game, and the gameplay really is focused around the fast-paced combat system!

To play the game use one of the various [MUD Clients](mud_clients.markdown) available, at your preference.
